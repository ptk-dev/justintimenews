{"title":"Ashok Gehlot claims BJP’s Vasundhara Raje helped save his government in 2020","content":"Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday claimed that three leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party, including Vasundhara Raje, had helped save his government during the 2020 revolt by Congress MLAs, reported PTI.In July 2020, Congress leader Sachin Pilot and 18 other party MLAs revolted against Gehlot’s leadership. Pilot, who represents the Tonk Assembly constituency, had demanded that he be made the chief minister. The political crisis lasted nearly a month and ended after the Congress formed a three-member panel comprising Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, KC Venugopal and Ahmed Patel to address his concerns. Later, Pilot was removed as the deputy chief minister and state Congress president.Addressing a programme in Dholpur district on Sunday, Gehlot claimed that the Congress government survived because of Raje, former Assembly speaker Kailash Meghwal and legislator Shobharani Kushwah. Dholpur is the home turf of Raje.“[Union ministers] Amit Shah, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Dharmendra Pradhan conspired together to topple my government,” the senior Congress leader alleged. “They distributed money in Rajasthan and they are not taking the money back now. I am surprised why they are not demanding the money back from them [the MLAs].”Gehlot said that Raje and Meghwal had spoken out against horse-trading and praised Kushwah for listening to them and not supporting the BJP.#WATCH | Rajasthan: \"...Vasundhara Raje (former CM) & former assembly speaker Kailash Meghwal said they don't have tradition here to topple elected govt through money-power.
