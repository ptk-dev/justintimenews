The Lok Sabha MP is slated to travel 6,200 kms across 15 states.The march has been passing through Assam since January 18 and has been met with several demonstrations by Bharatiya Janata Party workers, who allegedly vandalised posters, shouted slogans and blocked Gandhi’s convoy.Sarma had directed the state police to register a case against Gandhi after Congress workers allegedly broke barricades as they were stopped from entering Guwahati on Tuesday.The police attempted to stop them by beating them with batons.The Congress had been denied permission to enter the city had been denied to avoid disruption in traffic movement.On Wednesday, Sarma said that a special investigation team had been formed to inquire into the matter.“We have evidence against him [Gandhi],” Sarma said. “We will arrest him after the Lok Sabha polls because any action before the elections would invite unnecessary criticism.”This is not the first time Sarma has said that Gandhi would be arrested after the general elections.On January 19, Sarma had told reporters that if the Opposition party takes its march inside Guwahati, he would register a case of violation of orders and make arrests after two three months.Meanwhile, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday saying that the Assam Police has been found wanting in providing security to Gandhi during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.“The Assam Police has systematically stood by and/or allowed BJP workers to come closer and closer to the convoy of Shri Rahul Gandhi, breaching his security cordon and endangering his physical security and that of his team,” Kharge said.The Opposition party has also accused Sarma of being one of the most corrupt chief ministers in the country.Meanwhile, Gandhi alleged on Wednesday that Dhubri MP Badruddin Ajmal colludes with Sarma and the BJP.
