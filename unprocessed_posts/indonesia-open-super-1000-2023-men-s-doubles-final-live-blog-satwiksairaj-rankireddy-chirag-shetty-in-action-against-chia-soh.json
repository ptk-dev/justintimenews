In the earlier eight matches against them, we would sort of hold ourselves back, but today we stuck to the plan. We felt they are humans, they are players, and they will also make mistakes. We stuck to the plan right till the end and never really gave them a chance to come back. Even in the second game when they took a couple of points, we were like we don’t have to hold ourselves back and play safe that would have made the game a little slow and they are good at capitalising on. Am really happy and we really needed this win.”Satwik’s reaction to the win:“I am still happy with the way we played. It felt like a new day, playing new opponents. We were down 8-0 in head-to-head, but I wasn’t thinking much about it. I thought to myself this was a final and both teams were under pressure and whoever play good, will win. If they play good and win, we will say congratulations and go back to train. We were under control when we got a strike in the first game. I said to myself it’s our day don’t panic and just playing like any other final.”Correction: Satwik-Chirag are not entered in Taipei Open next week. — via BAI / BWF media\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    4.20 pm: Five straight-game wins in the finals today.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    #IndonesiaOpen2023 #IndonesiaOpenSuper1000 🏸\"Never thought I’d be in a final after the lead-up to this tournament.
