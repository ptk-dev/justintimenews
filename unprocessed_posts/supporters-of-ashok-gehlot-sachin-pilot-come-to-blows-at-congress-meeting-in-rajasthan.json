In order to salvage the situation, the Congress formed a three-member panel for addressing Pilot’s concerns. Pilot was then removed from the posts of deputy chief minister and state Congress president.In more recent times, Gehlot has called Pilot a traitor, while the latter has held a day-long fast and a foot march to urge his own government to take action against alleged corruption that took place during the previous Bharatiya Janata Party regime.Pilot has also threatened to launch a statewide agitation if his demands of disbanding the Rajasthan Public Service Commission and compensating those affected by paper leaks in government recruitment exams are not met, PTI reported.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-05-19T13:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190327-xbxfhrhslu-1684482284.jpeg","tags":["Ashok Gehlot","Sachin Pilot","Congress","Rajasthan","Rajasthan Congress"]}
