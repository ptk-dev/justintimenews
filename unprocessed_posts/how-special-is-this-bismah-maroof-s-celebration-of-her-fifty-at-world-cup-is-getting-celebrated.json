{"title":"'How special is this': Bismah Maroof's celebration of her fifty at World Cup is getting celebrated","content":"Australia won by seven wickets in their second match at the ICC Women’s ODI Cricket World Cup against Pakistan at the Bay Oval, Mount Maunganui, to reach the top of the points table with two wins in as many games so far. But their victory could have been simpler had Bismah Maroof not played a captain’s knock.Having lost the toss and asked to bat first, the captain scored 78* off 122 and built a 99-run partnership with Aliya Riaz (53), to post a 191-run target for Australia. Bismah, who was the first Pakistani player to score a half-century against Australia back in August 2014, went past the landmark again today and in the process registered the second highest individual score by a Pakistani batter in the tournament’s history.World Cup: Alyssa Healy stars as Australia defeat Pakistan, Bismah Maroof scores half century tooIn what was only her second One-Day International after a maternity leave, the highlight of the innings remained the cradle celebration by Bismah after she brought up her half-century. She dedicated the knock by gesturing towards her daughter Fatima in the dressing room, who has become a bit of a fan-favourite in the dressing room and social media since her arrival in New Zealand.It would have been great to have a win on #WomensDay but I want to tell all the women, especially little girls around the globe today: you are powerful, amazing & can pursue any dreams, no matter what. P.S thanks for all the love & prayers for me & my Fatima ❤️ #blessed pic.twitter.com/K2Ge0cV7PI— Bismah Maroof (@maroof_bismah) March 8, 2022\n\nCaptain Bismah Maroof dedicates her fifty to her daughter. #CricketTwitter #CWC22 #AUSvPAK pic.twitter.com/aHnJoPEGrc— Krithika (@krithika0808) March 8, 2022\n\nI am going to fall in love with Bismah Maroof. Look at her playing a 78* captain's knock and then dedicating it to her daughter ON WOMEN'S DAY?? #CWC22— Ariha Fatimah (@arihafatimah) March 8, 2022\n\nEarly contender for my favourite moment of the #CWC22 Pakistan cricket's maternity policy enabling Bismah Maroof to play the World Cup & Fatima's presence in New Zealand is both inspiring & important! #IWD2022 https://t.co/QS5AAiosXt— Zenia D'cunha (@ZENIADCUNHA) March 8, 2022\n\nBismah Maroof celebrating her fifty with a baby rocking gesture looking at her baby in the dressing room💛😍#CWC22 #AUSvPAK pic.twitter.com/Dk5f2b6KTS— Rohit Sankar (@imRohit_SN) March 8, 2022\n\nAfter the team’s opener against India, several videos of players from the Indian team along with Bismah and her daughter went viral on social media. Addressing the post-match press conference, she spoke about playing her first international match since the maternity break and leading the side in the World Cup.“It was a very different feeling and coming back in a World Cup and playing a match. I was a bit emotional and my mother and my daughter is there,” said Bismah.“It was a special moment for me and I really want to make it count – this tournament- because they both are here.”Little Fatima's first lesson in the spirit of cricket from India and Pakistan 💙💚 #CWC22 📸 @TheRealPCB pic.twitter.com/ut2lCrGL1H— ICC (@ICC) March 6, 2022\n\nSo much fun with the players trying to get our little Fatima to look into the camera.

The scheme became instantly available to all players and it began with Bismah, who took an indefinite break to prepare for motherhood.How special is this?! ❤️ these policies should be in place for ALL countries/women playing sports!!! Well done @TheRealPCB 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 https://t.co/Z36xj9MhRe— Marizanne Kapp (@kappie777) March 8, 2022\n\nMaroof is on 🔥. Sorry  couldn’t help myself. Also parental policies in action and showing their impact & importance.

But BCCI doesn't. Enough said. pic.twitter.com/5F3kgEsHon— Sushant Singh (@SushantSin) March 8, 2022\n\nA maiden ODI #CWC22 fifty from capt Bismah Maroof, the beneficiary of the first-ever player-specific maternity policy in the subcontinent, brought three generations of Pakistani women into focus on #IWD: Maroof, her mum, & her daughter. More on her journey:https://t.co/m4gN4dtvtM pic.twitter.com/nU8jot6vqf— Annesha Ghosh (@ghosh_annesha) March 8, 2022\n\nAs per one of the provisions in the policy that allows the player to travel with a support person of her choice to assist in caring for her infant child, Bismah is being accompanied by her mother in New Zealand. The two have been spotted either in the team bus, in the dressing room or interacting with players from other teams.Before the start of Pakistan’s campaign at the World Cup, Bismah had acknowledged the support she was offered and added that it helped her to return to the game smoothly.   She said: “The introduction of the maternal policy has made the game more inclusive for women. It is a great initiative, which will definitely see more girls follow their passion. With my daughter, Fatima, in the picture, I am excited to see how the next couple of months will pan out.”Corrections: The article has been updated to “Bismah, who was the first Pakistani player to score a half-century against Australia back in August 2014”","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-03-08T15:17:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/171217-fmrejeylnv-1646731330.jpg","tags":["Bismah Maroof","Australia vs Pakistan","icc women's odi cricket world cup","cricket","world cup"]}
