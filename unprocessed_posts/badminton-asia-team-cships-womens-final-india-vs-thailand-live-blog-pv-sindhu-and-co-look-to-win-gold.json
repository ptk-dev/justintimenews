It was the men’s team from the country, who were considered favourties for a podium finish, but at the end it is the women’s team, who come out victorious.The Indians were certainly the underdogs heading into the continental competition, but almost each player in the team stepped up when it mattered to play a vital role in the triumph. While the talks were around PV Sindhu’s return an three and a half month long injury lay-off, it is the young Anmol Kharb, who set the stage on fire in Shah Alam, Malaysia.Ashmita Chaliha gave a good glimpse of herself as did the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand. Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto were unlucky to miss out on the final with an injury, but they more than made up for it with their vocal presence at the sidelines.All in all a fairytale for India! \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    Team India lifts the 2024 Badminton Asia Team Championships Trophy\n\n    The Indian women's team pose with their 2024 Badminton Asia Championships gold medal \n\n    MATCH RESULT\n\n    #Badminton #BATC2024🏸The celebrations have begun in the Indian camp.

The Indian leads 11-5 at the mid-game interval and should be able to win this in straight games.

The Indian goes wide at the first point, but wraps up the first game 21-12 as the Thai shuttler finds the net once again.
