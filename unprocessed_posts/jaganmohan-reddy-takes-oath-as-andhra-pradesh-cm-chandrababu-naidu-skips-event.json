Governor ESL Narasimhan administered Reddy the oath of office at 12.23 pm at the IGMC Stadium in Vijayawada city. However, no Cabinet ministers took oath, The Hindu reported. Reddy’s council of ministers is likely to be constituted on June 7. On May 23, the YSR Congress swept to a landslide victory in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly polls, winning 151 out of the 175 seats in the legislature. The Telugu Desam Party, led by former Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, could win just 23 seats. In the Lok Sabha too, the YSR Congress Party secured 22 of the 25 seats in the state.In his address after taking oath, he said: “As a chief minister, I give you one assurance – I am here to listen to you and realise your dreams. The [YSR Congress Party] manifesto is Bible, Quran and Bhagavad Gita for me. It will be the guiding lamp for me for next five years.”Reddy announced that the new government will increase the old age pension from Rs 1,000 per month to Rs 2,250 this year, and Rs 2,500 in 2020. “The administration will be cleansed from top to bottom,” Reddy added. The chief minister said this process will take six months to a year.Reddy claimed that some media outlets – he named Eenadu, Andhra Jyothi and TV 5 Telugu news channel – wanted only Naidu to be the chief minister. “We will file defamation cases if they attempt to tarnish the image of the government,” he added.
