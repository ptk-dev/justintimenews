Operation Lotus is a term used to refer to the BJP‚Äôs alleged attempts to orchestrate defections in Opposition parties.However, Bharatiya Janata Party MP Parvesh Verma alleged that Kejriwal was a supporter of the ‚Äúliquor mafia‚Äù, and that he made the Rajghat memorial ‚Äúimpure‚Äù by visiting it. He added that BJP workers would go to the memorial and ‚Äúpurify‚Äù it by sprinkling water from the river Ganga over it.Verma also asked Kejriwal why he had not yet removed Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Aam Aadmi Party leader Satyendar Jain from the Delhi Cabinet.‚ÄúKejriwal ji, do not divert the subject,‚Äù the BJP MP said. ‚ÄúOnly say whether Sisodia alone took commission from the liquor mafia, or whether you took it as well.‚ÄùThe Central Bureau of Investigation has filed a first information report against 15 persons, including Sisodia, alleging irregularities in a liquor policy for the national capital. Jain too has been booked in a money-laundering case and is currently in judicial custody.   On the Aam Aadmi Party‚Äôs allegations, BJP MP from East Delhi Gautam Gambhir asked in a sarcastic vein: ‚ÄúKejriwal ji, did the BJP offer the prime minister‚Äôs post in 2024 to you?‚Äù‡§ï‡•á‡§ú‡§∞‡•Ä‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ú‡•Ä, ‡§ï‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç 2024 ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ß‡§æ‡§®‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§™‡§¶ ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ë‡§´‡§∞ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§¶‡•á ‡§¶‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•ã ‡§≠‡§æ‡§ú‡§™‡§æ ‡§®‡•á? ü§•‚Äî Gautam Gambhir (@GautamGambhir) August 25, 2022","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-08-25T16:40:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/178929-cbuzpxkfqq-1661422101.jpg","tags":["Arvind Kejriwal","BJP","AAP","Delhi","Parvesh Verma"]}
