Just far more dynamic in the forwardline. The goals need to come but hopefully they are the forward core. On cue from commentator: ‚ÄúSelvam Karthi has got gas doesn‚Äôt he (as in, really fast)... India look so much dangerous with him on the ball.‚Äù He had quite an impressive first half.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Q2, India 2-0 Argentina: Amit Rohidas blocks an Argentine goal-bound shot. That is the last action of the half. A good half of hockey for India that.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Q2, India 2-0 Argentina: End to end stuff now. Sreejesh does really well to put off the attacker and deny him a chance to shoot. India win the ball and spring the counter with Karthi once again going on a brilliant run. He squares it to Sukhjeet who cannot trap the ball cleanly and gives away a foul.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Q2, India 2-0 Argentina: Argentina with a sustained spell of possession now but India stand firm and do not let them make anything off it. They win the ball in their own circle and break on the counter. Mandeep Mor tries plays in a hopeful pass from the left to Akashdeep but it is intercepted and the attack break down.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Q2, India 2-0 Argentina: Argentina break the high Indian press and attack. The ball is played to Tomas Domene who hits a reverse shot. It is saved by Sreejesh but bounces high and so a PC is given. The Indian goalkeeper reviews it as he believes that the shot came off Domene‚Äôs back-stick. And the replays confirm it.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Q2, India 2-0 Argentina: Almost a third for India. Karthi goes on a lung-bursting run down the left beating a couple of Argentine players. He plays it to Akashdeep who beats his man with a touch and then smashes it goal-wards. The ball has Santiago beaten but flies just past the post. Karthi almost got a touch to it.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    #Hockey üèë #FIHProLeague Vivek Sagar Prasad with a delightful exchange with Akashdeep Singh followed by a lovely pass to the far post and Sukhjeet just slides in for a final tap in.

Vivek Sagar Prasad starts the move from defence with a clever feint and nutmeg. He plays it to Sukhjeet ahead who waits for VSP to join him. He wins a free hit and then cuts inside and flicks it towards the far post where Sukhjeet dives in to put the ball in goal.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Q1, India 1-0 Argentina: Another lovely move from India. Simranjeet with a clever little reverse to Akashdeep who plays it on to Mandeep.
