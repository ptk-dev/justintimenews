The constituency was a Samajwadi Party stronghold for the last 20 years and was important for the outfit’s prestige as socialist ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia had won it in 1967.Samajwadi Party founder and Dimple Yadav’s father-in-law Mulayam Singh Yadav had contested the election from the seat in 1999 and fielded Akhilesh Yadav in 2000. Akhilesh Yadav held fort till 2012, when he was elected chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.The Samajwadi Party had hoped that its alliance with Mayawati’s Bahujan Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal would give it an edge to counter any anti-incumbency sentiment.With the BSP’s significant Dalit voter base, the party assumed it would retain its seat where Muslims and Scheduled Caste communities account for 30% of the electorate.In April, rebel Samajwadi Party leader and Mulayam Singh Yadav’s brother Shivpal Yadav withdrew his Pragatisheel Samaj Party candidate in Kannauj.
