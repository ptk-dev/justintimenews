{"title":"Triple talaq case: Supreme Court reserves verdict on constitutional validity of the practice","content":"The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its order in the triple talaq case, ANI reported. The five-judge apex court bench, led by Chief Justice JS Khehar concluded its six consecutive day hearings of arguments from all the parties and petitioners involved. The Centre had sought to de-link the social practice from the tenets of Islam by stressing that it was a violation of gender equality. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board had told the Supreme Court that the practice of triple talaq was a matter of faith and ruled out the question of constitutional morality and equity.   On Wednesday, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, in reponse to queries raised, said it could include certain clauses in the “nikahnama” to protect the interests of women in a marriage contract. The board’s lawyer also said that Muslim women had the right to pronounce triple talaq in all forms, and also ask for a steep “mehr” amount in case of divorce, ANI reported. On May 11, when the court began to hear seven petitions challenging the controversial Islamic practice of oral divorce, it had clarified that it would not hear pleas challenging polygamy.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2017-05-18T15:14:03.410977+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/838011-46519-thzmfjutbx-1484151519.jpg","tags":["Triple talaq","Supreme Court","JS Khehar","All India Muslim Personal Law Board"]}
