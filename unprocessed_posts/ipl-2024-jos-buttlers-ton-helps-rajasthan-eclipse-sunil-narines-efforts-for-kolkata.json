{"title":"IPL 2024: Jos Buttler’s ton helps Rajasthan eclipse Sunil Narine’s efforts for Kolkata","content":"In a high-scoring match that had a centurion from both teams, it was Jos Buttler’s efforts that helped Rajasthan Royals get over the line by two wickets at the Eden Gardens, against hosts Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League on Tuesday.Asked to bat first at the toss, the Knight Riders powered their way to 223/6 at the end of 20 overs, courtesy Sunil Narine’s first-ever century. It was the third century by a player from the Kolkata team in IPL history.In the run-chase, the Royals got off to a good start, but slowed down after the fall of wickets and some tight bowling by the hosts.Buttler, the opening batter, managed to find his rhythm at the right time. And with help of a few cameos from Riyan Parag and Rovman Powell, Buttler managed to stitch together his seventh IPL century and help his team get to the 224-run target in the last ball of the match.With the win, the Royals equalled their own IPL record of highest successful run chase. They had chased a 224-run target set by the Punjab Kings in the 2020 season.#IPL2024 #KKRvsRRJos Buttler has done it!

The Royals’ run-rate dropped dangerously, as the required rate started to spike.But it all changed in the 15th over, when Buttler hit Varun Chakravarthy for four fours in an over that saw 17 runs being scored. That over gave the Royals’ batters some belief and opened the floodgates. Suddenly, the Royals started to pile on the runs rapidly.The 16th over went for 17 runs as well, followed by 16 runs in the 17th over. The 18th over had 18 runs and 19 were scored in the 19th to bring the equation to nine needed off the last six.Buttler thumped Chakravarthy for six off the first ball of the last over, and ran a double on the fifth ball to bring the scores level. In the last ball of the innings, he played it onto the leg-side to complete the winning run.#IPL2024 #KKRvsRRNo celebration from Jos Buttler, but he gets to his seventh IPL 100, and brings his team possibly a hit away from an impressive win.Rajasthan Royals need just three runs now from five balls.📷 Jio Cinemahttps://t.co/jBQIpqxKCD pic.twitter.com/mCF1mKPRao— The Field (@thefield_in) April 16, 2024\n\n\nThe Field’s player of the matchThere were two centurions today, but Narine’s efforts earned him The Field’s choice of player of the match.Narine scored his career’s first century – across formats – on Tuesday. His innings of 109 off 56 deliveries was littered with 13 boundaries and six sixes.

But he was asked about if he will be interested in playing the World Cup that starts in June, to which Narine gave an open-ended answer.“It is what it is, we’ll have to see what the future holds.”— Sunil Narine on if he will be playing at the upcoming T20 World Cup\nPoints table after the match on April 16 | Courtesy: Jio Cinema","author":"Shahid Judge","time":"2024-04-17T00:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/200097-lkcdfaczsp-1713293994.jpg","tags":["Jos Buttler","Sunil Narine","Rajasthan Royals","Kolkata Knight Riders","IPL 2024","Indian Premier League","IPL","Cricket"]}
