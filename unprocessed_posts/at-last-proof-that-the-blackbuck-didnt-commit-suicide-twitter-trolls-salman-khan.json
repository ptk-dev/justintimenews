{"title":"‘At last, proof that the blackbuck didn’t commit suicide’: Twitter trolls Salman Khan","content":"A 20-year-old blackbuck poaching case finally caught up with actor Salman Khan on April 5 when a Jodhpur court sentenced the actor to five years in jail.While shooting for Sooraj Barjatya’s Hum Saath Saath Hain in Jodhpur in September 1998, Salman Khan, along with his co-stars, Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Neelam, went out to hunt, which allegedly resulted in three chinkaras and two blackbuck being killed. Before this week’s conviction, Salman Khan had been acquitted in three cases related to the 1998 hunting expedition. On Thursday, Khan was finally found guilty of the poaching of two endangered blackbuck under the Wildlife (Protection) Act. But his Hum Saath Saath Hain co-stars were acquitted.This is not the first time Khan has had a serious brush with the law. In September 2002, the actor had been accused of driving his vehicle over people sleeping on a pavement in Mumbai, resulting in the death of one man. At the end of a long-drawn battle in the court, during which important case files disappeared and the primary witness died, the Bombay High Court in December 2015 ruled that Khan was not guilty.  So, finally, when Bollywood’s “bad boy” Khan received a five-year jail sentence on Thursday, a large section of people online and beyond felt that justice had been served. Soon enough, social media users got down to commemorate the moment with memes, jokes and everything in between. It took 20yrs for Judiciary to prove Blackbuck didn't commit suicide. #Salmanconvicted #BlackBuckPoachingCase— Sadhana Khamkar (@Sadhanak18) April 5, 2018\n\nJudge: Why did you come to Jodhpur in 1998.Salman Khan: To shoot...Judge: You have confessed.

SALMAN IS A NOT A MAN HE IS MOVEMENT— 🐿 (@prtxt) April 6, 2018\n\nSalman Khan didn't kill the black buck, he sent it to a better place which doesn't have his movies.— Pakchikpak Raja Babu (@HaramiParindey) July 25, 2016\n\nKhan’s jail sentence has put the prospects of his upcoming releases in uncertain territory. These projects including films like Kick 2, Dabangg 3, Bharat, in addition to Race 3, parts of which have already been shot. A user pointed out how the court’s verdict would indirectly affect the chances of another actor eager to re-brand himself in Bollywood by being a part of Khan’s upcoming film.Worse is the fact that Salman Khan’s conviction has jeopardised Bobby Deol’s comeback, Race 3. Spare a thought for his fans too.— Avinash Iyer (@IyerAvin) April 5, 2018\n\nMeanwhile, another user noted Khan’s track record of launching the film careers of a volley of new faces with questionable acting skills.Salman Khan should get another 5 years for launching Sooraj Pancholi, Athiya Shetty, Daisy Shah, Sneha Ullal, and Zarine Khan.— Pakchikpak Raja Babu (@HaramiParindey) April 5, 2018\n\nThe meme makers, meanwhile, made digs at various aspects of Khan’s chequered life, for example, the actor’s infamous brashness and ultra-machismo.Interviewer (1998) - Where do you see yourself in 20 years?Salman Khan - Here only pic.twitter.com/wlhby3Dz6X— Bade Chote (@badechote) April 5, 2018\n\nSalman bhai interrogating IG of Jodhpur Police. pic.twitter.com/C6uCbDbtDA— LOLendra Singh (@LOLendraSingh) April 5, 2018\n\nHis history of repeated courtoom appearances was also fodder for the meme-makers.These Salman Khan memes are lit af. 😂 #SalmanKhan pic.twitter.com/ewhh7YeQfV— Ahmad Anas (@AhmadAnas419) April 5, 2018\n\nSome users noted how Khan’s much-publicised humanitarian work through the actor’s organisation Being Human could not swing the verdict in the actor’s favour.#BlackBuckPoachingCase pic.twitter.com/prQTPoh1P8— Pakchikpak Raja Babu (@HaramiParindey) April 5, 2018\n\nOne user noted how the various people Khan had had tiffs with in the past such as singer Arijit Singh, actor Vivek Oberoi, and, well, of course, the poor blackbuck, were happy with the verdict.😂😂😂😂#BlackBuckPoachingCase  #BlackbuckPoaching  #BlackBuck  #SalmanKhan #SalmanConvicted #SalmanVerdict #BlackBuckCase #Jodhpur #JodhpurCentralJail  #SalmanBailOrJail  #salman Guilty pic.twitter.com/qhqerXN3Ud— Abhishek Joshi (@itsmeabjoshi) April 6, 2018\n\nSome were just silly fun.Salman Khan coming out of court after the verdict. #BlackBuckPoachingCase pic.twitter.com/xZJAuVGV1O— Pakchikpak Raja Babu (@HaramiParindey) April 5, 2018\n\nTiger jail me hai! #Braatchat #SalmanKhan #Jail #Memes #Trolls #FunnyVideos @BeingSalmanKhan #BlackBuckPoachingCase #JodhpurCentral pic.twitter.com/qquAqrEfED— Braatchat (@Braatchat) April 5, 2018\n\n#BlackBuckPoachingCase 😂😂😂Found this one gubeer pic.twitter.com/a9kyQdK2SR— santhanakrishnan (@76santhanakrish) April 5, 2018\n\nPic1: Salman outsidePic2: Salman inside the court #BlackBuckPoachingCase pic.twitter.com/P3FqaDWmjT— Rohit ForD🔞 (@Next_Abraham) April 5, 2018\n\nAnd why miss a chance to throw shade at Narendra Modi while you are at it?There was no blackbuck, it was just optical illusion just like \"Ache din  aa gaye for my bhakts\"#BlackBuckPoachingCase pic.twitter.com/xT6sb9m9Y4— Narendra Godi (@TrollModii) April 5, 2018\n\nSome Twitter users made fun of the fact that at the Jodhpur Central Jail, Khan had been put in a cell adjacent to that of rape convict and self-styled godman Asaram Bapu.Exclusive Video !!
