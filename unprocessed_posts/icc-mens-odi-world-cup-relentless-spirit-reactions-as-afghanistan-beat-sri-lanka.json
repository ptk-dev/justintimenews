{"title":"ICC Men’s ODI World Cup: ‘Relentless spirit’ – Reactions as Afghanistan beat Sri Lanka","content":"Afghanistan defeated Sri Lanka by seven wickets in Pune on Monday to record their third win of the ICC Men’s ODI World Cup and maintain their hopes of a semi-final place.Set 242 to win after a disciplined bowling display, Afghanistan finished on 242-3 with Azmatullah Omarzai unbeaten on 73 and captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 58 not out, the pair sharing an unbroken stand of 111.Victory meant Afghanistan, who had already beaten champions England, had won back-to-back matches at the World Cup for the first time after they defeated Pakistan by eight wickets last time out.Here’s a look at the reactions to Afghanistan’s impressive win:AFG used to be fascinating, thrilling, incredible,  But are now becoming clinical, organised, consistent. The brilliant & raw individual skills have now found a calming influence and a method ! Pretty sure Trott & Jadeja have played a big role. Top campaign #AFGvsL @ACBofficials— Jatin Sapru (@jatinsapru) October 30, 2023\n\nFabulous once again from Afghanistan. Their batting has gone to a new high in this World Cup. I would like to believe a significant part is due to long form players like Rahmat Shah and Hashmatullah Shahidi. Delighted for them— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) October 30, 2023\n\nMany congratulations Afghanistan for your third victory.

And all games won in style 🔥 #CWC23 Given the remaining games, they might still not make the cut for the semi finals but should secure a spot for #CT25— Aakash Chopra (@cricketaakash) October 30, 2023\n\nWow Afghanistan, what a performance. So much to learn from the spirit @ACBofficials have shown . Bangladesh has been around for 25 years and they haven’t beaten the big teams in a row so often as the Afghan boys have done in a much shorter span of time.
