If we collect Rs 100 as tax and give it to the Government of India, we are only getting Rs 12 to 13 back, that is our share.”On Monday, during the Budget Session of Parliament, Congress’ Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury cited Karnataka’s example while questioning the Union government why southern India states ruled by Opposition parties were being deprived of their dues by the Centre.In response, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that political interests do not come in the way of the states receiving funds from the Centre. “This apprehension that some states are being discriminated against is a politically-vitiated narrative,” she said.Sitharaman also suggested that the Congress government in Karnataka was incurring expenses that its own Budget could not sustain.The Union finance minister’s remarks followed that of Congress MP DK Suresh, who had criticised the interim Budget presented on February 1, saying that southern states will be forced to demand a separate country if the Centre does not provide them their rightful share of taxes.“Today, if we see the share of taxes distributed, North India is getting more,” Suresh had said. “From us [Karnataka] more than Rs 4 lakh crore is collected every year under various taxes. How much are we getting back? If it is not addressed in the 16th Finance Commission, then people of South India have to raise their voice.”Also read: How 15th Finance Commission is trying to manage South India’s anger over tax division – and failing","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-02-07T14:31:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/198228-oukaieqbwj-1707293544.jpg","tags":["Siddaramaiah","Karnataka","Congress","BJP"]}
