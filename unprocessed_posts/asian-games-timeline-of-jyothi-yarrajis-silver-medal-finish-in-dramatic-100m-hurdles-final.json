After reviewing the start, the officials disqualified Wu, and curiously, also Yarraji who was in lane five next to Wu.Yarraji appealed to the officials as did Wu and the pair were shown replays of the false start. The replays showed that Yarraji had moved after Wu had committed the false start but she did not take off. In lane three, Japan‚Äôs Masumi Aoki also false started following Wu.While Wu seemed to accept the decision, Yarraji refused and continued to appeal to the officials. She reportedly protested her case to officials, claiming that her hands were on the ground when Wu started.Wu chose to call upon the race under protest rule and took part in the race. Yarraji was also allowed to race and finished third behind Lin and Wu. The Athletics Federation of India appealed against Wu‚Äôs participation in the race and the Asian Games website was updated to show that Wu had been disqualified with Yarraji upgraded to silver.What is a false start?As the name suggests, a false start occurres when an athlete leaves their racing block before the gun has been fired. The starting block has sensors which record the athletes‚Äô reaction times after the gun has gone off. If an athlete‚Äôs reaction time is less than 0.100s, a signal will be emitted into an official‚Äôs headset and the athlete is disqualified from the race.What is race under protest?To prevent loss of time as athletes argue their case after false starts, World Athletics, the global body of track and field events, introduced the ‚Äòrace under protest‚Äô rule which allows athletes who have been disqualified due to a false starts, to compete in the race under appeal.After the race, the jury will analyse the data available to them and make their final decision. A big thanks to all.@Adille1 @Media_SAI pic.twitter.com/n1Ar7Bw7Q0‚Äî Athletics Federation of India (@afiindia) October 1, 2023\n\nDid Yarraji have a case?She certainly did. She argued with officials that her hands were on the track when Wu took off.Additionally, World Athletics has a rule which fell in Yarraji‚Äôs favour.‚ÄúIn practice, when one or more athletes make a false start, others are inclined to follow and, strictly speaking, any athlete who does so has also made a false start,‚Äù said rule 16.8 under World Athletics‚Äô competition rules guidelines. ‚ÄúThe Starter [officials] should warn or disqualify only such athlete or athletes who, in their opinion, were responsible for the false start.‚ÄùIn this case, Wu had made the false start, and based on her movement, Yarraji and Aoki also left the starting-block.Did Yarraji win?Yarraji was eventually upgraded to the silver medal while Wu ‚Äì who had finished second ‚Äì had been disqualified.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-10-01T20:20:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/194588-fqseashxst-1696171205.jpg","tags":["Jyothi Yarraji","Wu Yanni","Asian Games","Asian Games Hangzhou","Asian Games 2023","Indian Athletics","Asian Games 2023 Athletics"]}
