However, the police had suggested dropping charges involving a minor, which would have made his arrest imminent.The investigators have spoken to 108 witnesses in the six cases. Of these, 15 including players, coaches and referees backed up the claims made by the six wrestlers. The complainants have accused Singh of demanding sexual favours for professional help on at least two occasions, 15 incidents of molestation and other forms of sexual harassment.Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Harjeet Singh Jaspal at the Rouse Avenue Court in Delhi has asked Singh to appear before him on July 18. The police have urged the court to summon the witnesses whose corroborative statements have been added in the chargesheet.Also read: Wrestlers protest shows how Indian law is a tool of oppression rather than an instrument of justiceWitness corroborationsThree wrestlers supported the allegations of an athlete who had accused Singh of groping her several times while she was out for dinner at a restaurant, according to The Indian Express.
