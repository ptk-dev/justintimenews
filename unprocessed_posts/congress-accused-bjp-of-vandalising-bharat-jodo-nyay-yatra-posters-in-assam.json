{"title":"Congress accuses BJP of vandalising Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra posters in Assam","content":"The Congress on Saturday alleged that members of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing vandalised banners of the Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam’s Lakhimpur. The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, or India Justice and Unity March, is the second large-scale outreach programme of Congress in which Gandhi is slated to travel 6,200 km across 15 states. The Congress leader was on his third day’s journey through Assam when the party’s state unit raised the vandalism allegations. Gandhi will be travelling in Assam till January 25, after which the march will enter neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh.In a video the party shared on social media, a group of people can be seen getting out of a vehicle and tearing down posters of the march on a deserted street. The Congress claimed that the vandals were “followers” of Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. “Rahul Gandhi Ji’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra drawing thousands of cheering people in Assam has made the Himanta Biswa Sarma’s regime restless,” the party said. “While the chief minister is trying to detail the yatra by even threatening arrest, his followers are tearing off posters and banners of the yatra.”#DaroMatHimanta@RahulGandhi Ji's #BharatJodoNyayYatra drawing thousands of cheering people in Assam has made the @himantabiswa regime restless.

Wherever there are Muslims, they visit those places.”While the term “Miya” is used by Muslims across South Asia to mean “gentleman”, the word is seen in Assam as an ethnic slur to describe Muslims of Bengali origin.  Following this, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said on Friday that Gandhi’s march in the northeastern state has left Sarma scared. “When it comes Congress, Rahul Gandhi, he [Sarma] loses his mental stability,” said Ramesh. “The way every section of Assamese society has welcomed the yatra has left Assam’s chief minister confused and that is why he is talking rubbish.”Seeing the grand welcome of Rahul Gandhi by the people of Assam, the Chief Minister of Assam is shocked.#BharatJodoNyayYatra pic.twitter.com/tn9eCOJaeP— Assam Congress (@INCAssam) January 19, 2024","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-01-20T16:28:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/197690-tlqruutmjq-1705744449.jpeg","tags":["Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra","Rahul Gandhi","Assam","Congress","Himanta Biswa Sarma"]}
