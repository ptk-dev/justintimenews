The state has been gripped by ethnic clashes between the Meitei and Kuki communities since early May. Over 200 people have been killed since the conflict broke out and nearly 67,000 persons have been forced to flee their homes.In September, Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh had attributed the ethnic conflict to the free movement of people from across the Myanmar border. He had also urged the Union home ministry to “permanently” terminate the free movement regime and complete its fencing to check “influx”.On Thursday, Singh reiterated that the decision to scrap the regime “is crucial for our internal security and the demographic integrity of our North Eastern States”. “This is yet another historic decision in curbing illegal immigration and strengthening our internal security after the recent announcement to fence the 1,643-km Indo-Myanmar border by Government of India,” Singh added in a social media post.The Manipur government had already suspended the free movement regime in 2020, after the Covid-19 pandemic broke out.Also read: Why India wants to do away with the free movement regime along the Myanmar border","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-02-08T16:53:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/194323-jyvgpbtwos-1695394927.jpg","tags":["Myanmar","India","Free Movement Regime","Amit Shah"]}
