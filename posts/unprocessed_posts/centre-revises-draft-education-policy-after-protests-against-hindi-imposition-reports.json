{"title":"Centre revises draft education policy after protests against ‘Hindi imposition’","content":"The Centre on Monday tweaked its draft National Education Policy in the wake of protests against the emphasis on Hindi.“In keeping with the principle of flexibility, students who wish to change one or more of the three languages they are studying may do so in Grade 6 or Grade 7, so long as they are able to still demonstrate proficiency in three languages,” reads the revised draft, according to NDTV.A panel of experts led by former Indian Space Research Organisation chief Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan had recommended that students in non-Hindi speaking states learn a regional language, Hindi and English, while students in Hindi-speaking states learn Hindi, English and a modern Indian language from other parts of the country. However, the revised draft does not state which languages students must study in middle school, reported The News Minute.The ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu have raised objections against the draft education policy. The DMK welcomed the Centre’s move and said it was a success of former party chief M Karunanidhi’s legacy of opposing “imposition” of Hindi. “At a time when we are celebrating the birth anniversary of Thalaivar [leader] Kalaignar [Karunanidhi], the Central government withdrawing the Hindi compulsory subject clause shows that Kalaignar is living,” said party President MK Stalin. “Let us guard mother Tamil always breaking up the hegemonic imposition of Hindi.”தலைவர் கலைஞர் பிறந்தநாளை செம்மொழி நாளாக நாம் கொண்டாடும் வேளையில், இந்தி கட்டாயப் பாடம் என்பதை மத்திய அரசு திரும்பப் பெற்றிருப்பது, கலைஞர் வாழ்கிறார் என்பதைக் காட்டுகிறது. ஆதிக்க இந்தித் திணிப்பை எந்நாளும் தகர்த்து அன்னைத் தமிழைக் காப்போம்!#செம்மொழிநாள் #HBDKalaignar96 pic.twitter.com/mQRW3kvPVf— M.K.Stalin (@mkstalin) June 3, 2019\n\nThe Maharashtra Navnirman Sena led by Raj Thackeray also criticised the draft education policy. “Hindi is not the national language, do not enforce it on us and incite us,” said party spokesperson Anil Shidore on Twitter.The Centre, however, has been saying since Saturday that Hindi will not be imposed in schools in Tamil Nadu. “Public feedback will be sought, it is a misunderstanding that it has become a policy,” Union Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal had said. Union minister Prakash Javadekar and Union Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar also assured that the government does not want to impose any language on anybody.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2019-06-03T12:28:00.942962+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/121067-nypkqvgbhg-1559543150.jpg","tags":["National Education Policy","Centre","Hindi","Tamil Nadu","HRD"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/925733/centre-revises-draft-education-policy-after-protests-against-hindi-imposition-reports"}
