{"title":"Dadri lynching: Allahabad High Court stays arrest of Mohammad Akhlaq's family","content":"The Allahabad High Court on Friday stayed the arrest of the family members of Dadri lynching victim Mohammad Akhlaq, reported News18. The family had moved the high court after a Noida court had asked the Uttar Pradesh Police to file a case against them in July, following a petition filed by villagers who claimed they had seen Akhlaq’s brother Jaan Mohammad slitting a calf’s throat.Akhlaq was beaten to death in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, in September 2015 following rumours that he and his family had killed a calf and eaten beef during Eid festivities. A forensic report in May said that the meat found in the victim’s house was that of a cow or its progeny. Uttar Pradesh police chief Javed Ahmed had said the new report “does not diminish the case as murder is an offence”. Beef eating is not a crime in Uttar Pradesh, only cow slaughter is.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2016-08-26T12:51:07.060148+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/814965-31554-yxjaymxime-1468520685.jpg","tags":["Dadri beef row","Mohammad Akhlaq","Allahabad High Court"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/814965/dadri-lynching-allahabad-high-court-stays-arrest-of-mohammad-akhlaqs-family"}
