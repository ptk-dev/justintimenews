{"title":"Iran: Protests erupt at funeral of woman who  died after arrest by morality police","content":"Protests erupted in western Iran on Saturday as a 22-year-old woman died after being detained by the regime’s morality police for allegedly not following the country’s hijab regulations, the BBC reported.The woman, Mahsa Amini, was detained on Tuesday in the Iranian capital of Tehran by the police unit that enforces the Islamic republic’s obligatory dress codes, including the compulsory wearing of the headscarf in public. The headscarf and other conservative dress codes, which are mandatory for women of all nationalities and religions in Iran, have been compulsory since the country’s 1979 revolution.Witnesses claimed that Amini was beaten in the police van and fell into a coma, but the authorities have refuted the allegations, according to the BBC. The police on Friday claimed that Amini had suffered sudden heart failure. According to them, she fell sick while she was waiting with other detainees at a morality police station, Reuters reported.Amini’s family has disputed the claim saying she was healthy and had not been suffering from any health problems before her detention.The news of her death emerged weeks after Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called for strict enforcement of the dress codes.On Saturday, videos posted on social media showed women removing their veils to protest Amini’s death and the government’s ultraconservative dress codes. At her funeral in Saqez, in the western province of Kurdistan, protestors shouted “death to the dictator” – a reference to Supreme Leader Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei.Women of Iran-Saghez removed their headscarves in protest against the murder of Mahsa Amini 22 Yr old woman by hijab police and chanting:death to dictator!Removing hijab is a punishable crime in Iran.
