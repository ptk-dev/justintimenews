Justifying his use of the word “mini-Pakistan”, Mishra alleged that the protestors in Delhi have been pelting stones at the police and calling for “Azad Kashmir”, just like it is done in Pakistan. Mishra said that while the demonstrators have a right to protest, they cannot illegally occupy public places.Delhi BJP leader Vijay Goel has distanced his party from Mishra’s remarks, Times Now reported. When asked about this, Mishra claimed that the whole country supports his remarks.The Citizenship Amendment Act, passed by Parliament on December 11 and notified by the Centre on January 10, provides citizenship to refugees from six minority religious communities from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, provided they have lived in India for six years and entered the country by December 31, 2014. The Act has been widely criticised for excluding Muslims, leading to protests against it. At least 26 people died in the protests last month – 19 in Uttar Pradesh, five in Assam and two in Karnataka.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2020-01-23T19:35:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/58673-xrvubljfms-1579786842.jpg","tags":["Kapil Mishra","Aam Aadmi Party","Delhi elections","Citizenship Amendment Act","BJP"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/950874/delhi-elections-india-vs-pakistan-match-on-february-8-tweets-bjp-leader-kapil-mishra"}
