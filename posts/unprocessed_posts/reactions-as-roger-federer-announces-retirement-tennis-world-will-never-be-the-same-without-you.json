{"title":"Reactions as Roger Federer announces retirement – ‘Tennis world will never be the same without you’","content":"Swiss tennis legend Roger Federer is to retire after next week’s Laver Cup after admitting on Thursday his battles with a knee problem had forced him to call time on his historic career.“The Laver Cup next week in London will be my final ATP event,” he said in a statement posted on his Twitter account. The 41-year-old winner of 20 Grand Slam titles has been out of action since a quarter-final loss at Wimbledon in 2021, after which he underwent his third knee surgery in 18 months.It becomes the second major farewell in tennis in quick time. His fellow tennis legend Serena Williams is all but certain not to play again after bowing out of the US Open in the third round this month, although some reconsideration seems to be on the cards for the 23-time women’s singles Major champion. Federer said that his body had effectively told him it was time to bring the curtain down.“I’ve worked hard to return to full competitive form,” he wrote.“But I also know my body’s capacities and limits, and its message to me lately has been clear.“I am 41 years old. I have played more than 1500 matches over 24 years.“Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognize when it is time to end my competitive career.”Here’s a look at the reactions as the 20-time Grand Slam champion announced his retirement: Roger,Where do we begin? It's been a privilege to witness your journey and see you become a champion in every sense of the word.We will so miss the sight of you gracing our courts, but all we can say for now is thank you, for the memories and joy you have given to so many. pic.twitter.com/VDWylKvW86— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) September 15, 2022\n\nRoger… 💔— Carlos Alcaraz (@carlosalcaraz) September 15, 2022\n\nI just want to thank you for everything you've done and everything you are for our sport.

There are beautiful tennis players. Players with an extraordinary range. Players who move so quick and yet slow down time. Players who reach a level that you had no idea existed.
