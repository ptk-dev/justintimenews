In his flurry of shots, he managed to lash at a Mohsin Khan delivery that flew straight to Yash Thakur standing in the second slip position. Thakur timed his jump well, but fluffed what should have been a straight-forward catch in the 13th over.Jurel was at 31 at the time, and went on to score an important 52 off 34 ‚Äì his first T20 half-century.Just a few balls later, Jurel edged another one, only for it to be put down again by Thakur. To be fair, this was a difficult chance and it would have been a spectacular catch had it been taken.Remarkably, there was another chance to dismiss Jurel that went begging, and once again it involved Khan and Thakur.In the 18th over, Samson cut a slower delivery straight to Thakur at slip. Jurel however, ran almost the entire length of the pitch despite his captain declining the run. Thakur noticed the mix-up and threw the ball to Khan. Jurel had started to rush back to make his ground when Khan fumbled the ball in his attempt to find the stumps, giving the batter a third reprieve in the same innings.The Field‚Äôs player of the matchSamson, for his destructive 71 off 33 ‚Äì an innings peppered with seven fours and four sixes ‚Äì was the player of the match.During his stay at the crease, he saw Jos Buttler getting dismissed and Riyan Parag also being sent back early. At that stage, the Royals‚Äô chase could have gone either way. But the right-handed batter played it slow at the start, allowing Jurel to play the aggressor. Once he was set, Samson started to attack the Lucknow bowlers, finding the gaps almost at will.His magnificent innings came with a strike rate of 215, and it took him to the second spot in the leaderboard for most runs scored this season, with 385 in nine innings ‚Äì second only to Virat Kohli‚Äôs 430.‚ÄòTicking those small right crosses‚ÄôThe Royals have now won eight of their nine matches to record the joint-best run in the tournament‚Äôs history, along with the Gujarat Titans.Captain Samson asserted that the performances have been all about focusing on the process and ticking the right boxes.‚ÄúWe have to keep ticking those small right crosses. You never know, the results can go here and there. And in the T20 format, mistakes are supposed to happen.‚ÄúIn the team meetings we decide that we just have to take care of the process and stick to that. I think we have been [getting] the results in our [favour]. There is something we are doing really well, we have recognised that and we want to stick to that each and every game.‚Äù‚Äî Sanju Samson during the post-match presentation","author":"Shahid Judge","time":"2024-04-28T00:04:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/200334-bwlcvouwkl-1714242820.jpg","tags":["Sanju Samson","Dhruv Jurel","IPL 2024","Indian Premier League","IPL","Rajasthan Royals","Lucknow Super Giants","LSG vs RR","Cricket"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1067144/ipl-2024-sanju-samson-and-dhruv-jurel-earn-rajasthan-royals-easy-win-over-lucknow-super-giants"}
