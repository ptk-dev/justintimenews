{"title":"Roger Federer retires: Federer-Nadal go down in thriller, Swiss great bows out in emotional farewell","content":"6.00 am: Maybe he could have played on a little bit longer. Maybe the farewell could have been at Wimbledon. But maybe it was supposed to be this way. Maybe, like he did on the court through his career, he timed this quite perfectly. Surrounded by his great rivals and friends, his mentors, his idols his parents, his kids... and Mirka. He didn’t win the tennis match on the night, but Roger Federer won at tennis alright.‘What an incredible person to celebrate’: Reactions as Roger Federer retires after a 24-year career\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    If there's one thing you watch today, make it this.#LaverCup | @rogerfederer pic.twitter.com/Ks9JqEeR6B— Laver Cup (@LaverCup) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n    end of an era pic.twitter.com/tExoDBooib— Twitter Sports (@TwitterSports) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n    Wow… 💔 Thanks RF— Carlos Alcaraz (@carlosalcaraz) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n    Damn you Roger … will be walking around with swollen eyes for the whole weekend . 😢— Kim Clijsters (@Clijsterskim) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n    Had to make it, even with my limited skill.This is so rare in sport (and life)#Fedal is❤️and we got to watch them grow together! https://t.co/HvU4eyvsDC pic.twitter.com/Gsh1Z2z4x5— Zenia D'cunha (@ZENIADCUNHA) September 24, 2022\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Federer said in his press conference: “For us as well to go through a career that we both have had and to come out on the other side and being able to have a nice relationship I think is maybe a great message as well to not just tennis but sports and maybe even beyond”How else do you describe this? \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    #ThankYouRoger What did we do to deserve them? ♥️https://t.co/nfYiZGe8J7 pic.twitter.com/zAtcWvtAEn— Vinayakk (@vinayakkm) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n    💔🥺 pic.twitter.com/ltChldefGn— Prithvi (@Eighty7_Fifty8) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n    Jim Courier 🤗 Roger Federer.peRFect ending.https://t.co/nfYiZGe8J7 pic.twitter.com/JV7ujjvxD1— Vinayakk (@vinayakkm) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    “Finally, to the game of tennis: I love you and will never leave you”  Just keep up your word there, Roger.

I have had the immense fortune to play in front of you in over 40 different countries. I have laughed and cried, felt joy and pain, and most of all I have felt incredibly alive. Through my travels, I have met many wonderful people who will remain friends for life, who consistently took time out of their busy schedules to come watch me play and cheer me on around the globe. Thank you.When my love of tennis started, I was a ball kid in my hometown of Basel. I used to watch the players with a sense of wonder. They were like giants to me and I began to dream. My dreams led me to work harder and I started to believe in myself. Some success brought me confidence and I was on my way to the most amazing journey that has led to this day.So, I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart, to everyone around the world who has helped make the dreams of a young Swiss ball kid come true.Finally, to the game of tennis: I love you and will never leave you.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    TT, here's a thread of humour and nerdy fandom references which we can pretend are coping mechanisms as we get ready for the Federer farewell (via Fedal content because they always serve!) https://t.co/IHdZPJkRpw— Zenia D'cunha (@ZENIADCUNHA) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n    In a 2 hour, 28 minute battle, Alex De Minaur scores Team World its first point of the weekend, besting Andy Murray.#LaverCup pic.twitter.com/oWgRQBPG5C— Laver Cup (@LaverCup) September 23, 2022\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Andy Murray 7-5 3-6 (7-10) Alex de Minaur: Di Minaur wins!
