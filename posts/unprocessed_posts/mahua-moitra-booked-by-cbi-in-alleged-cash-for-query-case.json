In total, Hiranandani posted 58 questions that were asked by Moitra in Parliament, the Lokpal order had said on Tuesday citing the central agency’s preliminary inquiry findings.The anti-corruption body said the allegations against the Trinamool Congress leader were backed by cogent evidence and were extremely serious.Moitra, who represented West Bengal’s Krishnanagar constituency, was expelled from Parliament on December 8 based on a motion moved by Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi.The motion was based on a recommendation by the Lok Sabha’s Ethics Committee that had found Moitra guilty of having shared her login credentials to the Parliamentary website with Hiranandani and accepting gifts in exchange for asking the questions in Parliament.The allegations against the politician were made in October by Bharatiya Janata Party MP Nishikant Dubey and advocate Jai Anant Dehadrai, her estranged partner.However, Moitra, alleged that the ethics panel found her guilty of breaching a code that did not exist.
