{"title":"No kabaddi gold for Indian men at the Asian Games for the first time, defeated by Iran in semi-final","content":"For the first time in Asian Games history, India will not be the champions of the men’s kabaddi event as Iran thrashed the men in blue to record a thumping 27-18 win in the semi-final.Kabaddi, which was introduced in 1990 to the continental championship, is a sport dominated by India, who have won the gold medal seven times in the men’s event and twice in the women’s. But on Thursday, Iran brought that run to a screeching halt, putting in a defensive display for the ages and preventing India from scoring points on their raids for most of the second half after the teams were tied 9-9 in the first.The defeat meant Indian men will return with a bronze from the Asian Games. The women’s team are still in contention for gold and will take on Iran in the final.  The writing was perhaps on the wall given that Iran had come close to upstaging India in the 2014 finals in Incheon. Considered another Asian powerhouse, Iran had finished runner-up in the last two Asian Games and will square off for gold as firm favourites against Korea, a team that beat India in the group stage this time. The match saw Pro-Kabaddi players facing each other with Iran having the likes of defenders Fazel Atrachali and Abozar Mighani. The Indian team which had stars like Ajay Thakur, Pardeep Narwal, Rahul Chaudhari, Deepak Niwas Hooda, flattered to deceive. As the Indians slumped to the mat, their faces a picture of disbelief, the Iranian spirits soared. The chest-bumping, wide smiles and dancing fans in the stands made for dramatic images.
