Mumtaz comes to give her a hug.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    #WTC23 #WTCFinal #AUSvIND280 runs to go for India. 7 wickets to go for Australia.Join us for an interesting final day! üçøLive:  https://t.co/lFG22c6cXo‚Äî The Field (@thefield_in) June 11, 2023\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Final, Q2 India 0-0 Korea: STROKE INDIA! \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Final, Q2 India 0-0 Korea: Right, a brief delay before the PC as the Korean defender came worse off. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Final, Q2 India 0-0 Korea: Rare India attack and led by Rutaja down the left flank.
