{"title":"ICC U19 Women's T20 World Cup, IND v ENG final as it happened: India are crowned world champions","content":"9.00 pm: And so India are World Champions. They started as one of the favourites. They finish as the winners.   You knew Shafali & Richa, but now likes of Shweta, Trisha, Soumya, Titas, Archana, Mannat, Parshavi, Sonam, Hrishita... become names to watch out for. The primary credit goes to the players and staff of course. BCCI put together a pool of players early, good volume of domestic cricket, then vs international sides. Named a couple of senior stars for good measure and a coach who knew how to work with them. They clearly identified this as a tournament to be won and succeeded.A day to savour for Indian cricket.

Not long to go for the senior ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in South Africa, this is the first major final in cricket of 2023. The inaugural edition of the long-awaited U19 Women’s World Cup has lived up to the expectations with some fascinating results along the way but the cream has risen to the top. Two of the best teams in the pre-tournament discussions are here to compete for the title. Sure, at this level, winning the title is secondary, the development of these young cricketers is paramount. But make no mistake, both these sets of players would love to get their hands on that trophy and be remembered as the first champions. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    #indvseng | It's #U19T20WorldCup final day.Shafali Verma’s India vs Grace Scrivens’ England in inaugural title clashRead more: https://t.co/JxFyKo3XP8 via @thefield_in pic.twitter.com/LH30BKwHtX— Scroll.in (@scroll_in) January 29, 2023\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Also read:U19 Women’s T20 World Cup: You know Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh, meet rest of India’s squadICC U19 Women’s T20 World Cup: Squads, format, schedule, broadcasters – a ready reckonerScreenshots in the blog courtesy FanCode and ICC","author":"Vinayakk Mohanarangan","time":"2023-01-29T16:46:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/186252-tadjbbldmy-1675047346.jpeg","tags":["Shafali Verma","Grace Scrivens","India vs England","U19 World Cup final","ICC WOMENS U19 T20 WORLD CUP 2023","ICC U19s Women's T20 World Cup 2023"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1042821/icc-u19-women-s-t20-world-cup-india-vs-england-final-live-shafali-verma-co-vs-grace-scriven-co"}
