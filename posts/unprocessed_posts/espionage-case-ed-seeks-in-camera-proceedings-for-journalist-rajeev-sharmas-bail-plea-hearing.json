In-camera proceedings are not open to the public and the press.The Delhi Police arrested Sharma in September 2020 and booked him under the Official Secrets Act for allegedly passing on information about the Indian Army’s deployment and the country’s border strategy to Chinese intelligence. The police had claimed that Sharma was in possession of defence-related classified documents.The police had also arrested a Chinese woman and her Nepalese associate for allegedly paying Sharma large amounts of money routed through shell companies in exchange of classified information.After the first information report was registered in the matter, the Enforcement Directorate began an investigation and registered a case of money laundering against Sharma, reported The Indian Express. The central agency has filed a chargesheet in the case under the Official Secrets Act.Senior Advocate Mohit Mathur, representing Sharma, had argued that the central agency was carrying out the instant parallel investigation along with the special cell of the Delhi Police in order to harass Sharma.The freelance journalist got bail in December in the complaint filed by the police but remained in custody in the Enforcement Directorate’s case.During the hearing on Thursday, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju informed the High Court about the Enforcement Directorate’s application.
