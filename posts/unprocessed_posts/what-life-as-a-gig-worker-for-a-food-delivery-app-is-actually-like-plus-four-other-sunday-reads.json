{"title":"What life as a gig worker for a food delivery app is actually like, plus four other Sunday reads","content":"When algorithms dictate your work: Life as a food delivery ‘partner’Food delivery services have long been one of the most visible sectors of India’s burgeoning gig economy, with that trend only becoming more visible as a result of Covid-19 pandemics. And with yet another battle between services to offer short-turnaround grocery delivery, it is clear that the reliance on a host of young workers on bikes and mopeds racing through our cities to delivery goods as fast as they can is only going to increase.

Because the United States labels the Taliban as a “specially designated global terrorist”, Facebook has banned all praise and support of the organisation. What happens now that the Taliban are actually in control of a country? What if they receive official recognition from a number of other governments and international bodies?

Douglas Preston the tale of mountaineers who were discovered having slashed their way out of their tents, wearing little of the warm hiking gear that they had available, having been hit by blunt force damage not unlike that caused by an “automobile moving at high speed”, some of whom had burns on their faces, and pieces of their own flesh in their mouths, while others were wearing patches of clothing from the rest of the gang.

Aruna D’Souza, in the New York Times, takes a look at a new exhibition that focuses on the first 15 years of Sikander’s career, in which, “East and West, along with other apparently opposed terms – masculine and  feminine, abstraction and figuration, traditional and contemporary,  here and there – morph and bleed into each other.”More here.","author":"Rohan Venkataramakrishnan","time":"2021-08-22T09:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/140244-yfrhcppakk-1589796453.jpg","tags":["Weekend Reads","Food delivery services","algorithms"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1003427/what-life-as-a-gig-worker-for-a-food-delivery-app-is-actually-like-plus-four-other-sunday-reads"}
