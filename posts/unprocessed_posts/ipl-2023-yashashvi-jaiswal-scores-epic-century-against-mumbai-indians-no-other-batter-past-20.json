{"title":"IPL 2023: Yashashvi Jaiswal scores epic century against Mumbai Indians, no other batter crosses 20","content":"Since IPL 2022 began, a total of 11 centuries have been scored in the league, including three this year.   Five of those have been against Mumbai Indians, including two this year. The latest to go after MI’s bowling attack is Yashasvi Jaiswal, one of Mumbai’s own, as he slammed a superb 124 off 62 balls at the Wankhede Stadium for Rajasthan Royals against Rohit Sharma’s MI. RR posted 212/7 in the IPL’s 1000th match.And while MI have conceded five centuries in the last last two seasons, RR batters have scored five too. The other four were by Jos Buttler last season.In fact, Buttler was the second highest-scoring batter on Sunday night for RR but what is incredible is that it was a 19-ball 18. Extras, at 25, was the second highest contributor for RR as Jaiswal played one of the all-time great knocks of the tournament.The century however wasn’t enough for RR as MI won the match with three balls to spare. #IPL2023  🚨 Another match finishes with a flurry of sixes! 6️⃣ 6️⃣ 6️⃣ goes Tim David as MI chase the target down with three balls to spare!
