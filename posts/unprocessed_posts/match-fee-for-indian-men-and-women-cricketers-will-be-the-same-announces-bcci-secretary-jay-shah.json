Jai Hind 🇮🇳— Jay Shah (@JayShah) October 27, 2022\n\nBased on matches played since the start of 2021, this is how the proposed pay structure would look like.(Table by Scroll.in)This move comes on the back of BCCI deciding in its Annual General Meeting held in Mumbai on 18 October to launch the much-awaited Women’s Indian Premier League.“The General Body approved to conduct the Women’s Indian Premier League,” said Jay Shah in the statement issued by BCCI detailing the key decisions made at the AGM.The other details of the tournament are not known at this point.The BCCI had been conducting the Women’s T20 challenge up until now, which featured three teams in the most recent edition and had four matches. The Women’s Big Bash League, FairBreak Invitational, Women’s Hundred and Women’s Caribbean Premier League are the top leagues in the women’s game at the moment.The Indian women’s cricket team were recently runners-up at the Commonwealth Games, and champions at the Asia Cup. Earlier this year, in July, New Zealand cricket had announced equal match fees as well.“New Zealand’s professional women’s and men’s cricketers will receive the same pay for the same work on the same day, in a landmark agreement struck between NZC, the six Major Associations, and the New Zealand Cricket Players Association,” the NZC had said.“The five-year deal, the first in which the men’s and women’s professional environments have been combined in one agreement, will see the WHITE FERNS and domestic women’s players receiving the same match fees as the men across all their formats and competitions.”This is a historic decision for women’s cricket in India! The pay equity policy along with the WIPL next year, we are ushering into a new era for women's cricket in India. Thank you @JayShah Sir & the @BCCI for making this happen. Really happy today. https://t.co/xOwWAwsxfz— Mithali Raj (@M_Raj03) October 27, 2022","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-10-27T13:08:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/181318-enptldhewy-1665830788.jpeg","tags":["Jay Shah","BCCI","Board of Control for Cricket in India","Gender equality","Harmanpreet Kaur"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1035989/match-fee-for-indian-men-and-women-cricketers-will-be-the-same-announces-bcci-secretary-jay-shah"}
