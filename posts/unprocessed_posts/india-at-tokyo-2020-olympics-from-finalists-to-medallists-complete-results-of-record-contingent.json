{"title":"India at Tokyo 2020 Olympics: From finalists to medallists, complete results of record contingent","content":"India sent a record contingent to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, surpassing their mark from Rio 2016. While the initial contingent was tallied at 119 athletes, Sumit Nagal (tennis) and Diksha Dagar (golf) also made the cut late, making the contingent officially 121-member strong as per the International Olympic Committee. It is worth noting that a squad of 16 was allowed for a hockey match but Indian teams also used two players from their reserves and a total of 18 players made appearances in the tournament. In athletics, some members of the original squad of 119 did not end up participating in any of the relay events. So the count of who represented India in various events stands approximately at 120-plus.The Games started off with a bang for India, with a silver for weightlifter Mirabai Chanu on the first official day of action and finished with wrestler Bajrang Punia and javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra (with a gold, no less) pushing the country past their previous highest medal tally. While the medal winners will be celebrated in the years to come, it is important to recognise and, at the very least, record the achievements of every athlete who went to the Olympics. One of the things you always hear associated with the Olympics is how participation at the Games is no mean feat, but it is especially more so in a year like 2021. The pandemic-delayed Games made things challenging in some way or the other for every athlete to took part. Here, we take a look at the overall results from every event featuring an Indian athlete: India's updated entry count for Tokyo Olympics  \n    \n       Discipline  Female  Male  Total \n    \n     Archery  1  3  4  Artistic Gymnastics  1  0  1  Athletics  8  17*  25  Badminton  1  3  4  Boxing  4  5  9  Equestrian  0  1  1  Fencing  1  0  1  Golf  2  2  4  Hockey  16 (+2)  16 (+2)  32  Judo  1  0  1  Rowing  0  2  2  Sailing  1  3  4  Shooting  7  8  15  Swimming  1  2  3  Table Tennis  2  2  4  Tennis  2  1  3  Weightlifting  1  0  1  Wrestling  4  3  7  Total  53  68  121 \n   A squad of 16 allowed for a game but Indian teams also used two players from their reserves and a total of 18 players made appearances in the tounament Tokyo 2020: Data check – India’s most successful Olympics campaign with seven medalsFrom Mirabai Chanu to Neeraj Chopra via PV Sindhu: India’s seven medals at Tokyo Olympics India's medal winners at Tokyo Olympics \n    \n       Medal  Name  Sport  Event  Date \n    \n      Silver   Mirabai Chanu  Weightlifting  Women's 49 kg  24 July   Bronze  PV Sindhu  Badminton  Women's singles  1 August   Bronze  Lovlina Borgohain  Boxing  Women's welterweight  4 August   Silver  Ravi Kumar Dahiya  Wrestling  Men's freestyle 57 kg  5 August   Bronze  Men's hockey team  Field hockey  Men's tournament  5 August   Gold  Neeraj Chopra  Athletics  Men's javelin throw  7 August   Bronze  Bajrang Punia  Wrestling  Men's freestyle 65 kg  7 August \n  ArcheryArchery is one of the most exciting live events to watch at the Olympic Games and it sure produced stunning moments from the Indian athletes. Pravin Jadhav was arguably the find of the Games, finishing as the best male archer in the qualification and earning a shot at the mixed team event with Deepika Kumari. He was even more impressive in the men’s team event defeat against Korea, while going on to defeat the world No 2 archer in the individual event.Atanu Das produced the moment of the archery campaign for India when he stunned Korean legend Oh Jinhyek in a shootoff. At the end of it all, the wait for the first medal is still not over. Deepika Kumari, ranked world No 1, paid the price for being the ninth seed in qualification and ended up meeting the eventual champion An San in the quarterfinal. A better seeding would have taken her to the semifinal and given her a real shot at medal. Das also failed to make the most of a wide open men’s draw that saw none of the top eight seeds finish on the podium. He’d perhaps be the most disappointed across the board.The expectations were high this time, and the contingent did not do themselves any favour by starting off poorly in the qualification round and ending up with difficult draws across the board as a result of their ranking round performances.

In vault, she registered only one attempt, while two attempts are needed for consideration to reach final.

Apart from the javelin champion, Kamalpreet Kaur stood out by qualifying to the discus throw final with the second best throw. In the final, she couldn’t quite get going, finishing sixth. Avinash Sable continued his fine knack of setting a new personal bests at big events, rewriting his own national record in 3000m steeplechase. The men’s 4x400m relay produced an impressive performance to set a new Asian Record (and a national record, by extension of course) but, like Sable, fell agonisingly short of qualifying for the final.Elsewhere though, there was disappointment galore for the athletes. While no one other than Neeraj, and perhaps Kamalpreet, were seen as medal contenders, a vast majority of them couldn’t get anywhere close to their personal bests. Perhaps an indication that they had peaked before the Games, trying to attain qualifying marks at the 11th hour.

She became the first Indian woman athlete to win two Olympic medals. Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty were incredibly unlucky that the things panned out in such a way that despite defeating the eventual champions and winning two out of three group stage matches, they could not progress to the knockouts. For B Sai Praneeth, there was disappointment as he paid the price for a shock defeat in his opening group match and got eliminated even before starting his second. It was unfortunate for India because the knockout draw opened up big time for Sai with the elimination of Ng Ka Long Angus and Kento Momota in the group stages, leaving the door open for a run to the semi-finals and a possible medal.Behind PV Sindhu’s success, an incredible mindset to win and a strong support systemThe importance of being PV Sindhu Badminton  \n    \n       Event  Athletes  Results \n    \n     Men's Singles  B Sai Praneeth  Group stage: Lost against Misha Zilberman and Mark Caljouw in straight games  Women's Singles  PV Sindhu  Group stage: Defeated Ksenia Polikarpova, Cheung Ngan Yi in straight games Round of 16: Defeated Mia Blichfeldt in straight gamesQF: Defeated Akane Yamaguchi in straight gamesSF: Lost against Tai Tzu Ying in straight gamesBronze medal: Defeated He Bingjiao in straight games  Men's Doubles  Satwiksairaj Rankireddy & Chirag Shetty   Group stage: Defeated Lee/Wang in three games, lost against Gideon/Sukamuljo in straight games, defeated Sean/Vendy in straight games \n  BoxingAn unprecedented nine Indian boxers – five men and four women – made the cut for the showpiece but only one of them could finish on the podium, with Lovlina Borgohain (69kg) securing the lone medal, India’s first in nine years. She reached the semifinals to assure bronze and lost to the eventual champion.Handed tricky draws, the men, however, could log just one win across the board – through debutant super heavyweight Satish Kumar – while world no 1 Amit Panghal (52kg) was among the rest who lost in the opening round. Mary Kom endured the heartbreak of a hard-fought, and in her mind an unfair, split decision defeat. The star of the contingent, without a doubt, was Borgohain for her two wins against quality opponents and putting up a fight till the end against a red-hot boxer in the semifinal.

Aditi Ashok made thousands of Indians not only watch golf for the first time at the Olympics, but made them curious about rules and follow her quest for what would have frankly been a ridiculous medal. It was agonising. It stings.

Even in the semifinal and bronze medal match, the team lost out only by the finest margins. The men’s team suffered just two defeats in the tournament, coming against the eventual finalists, and produced a thriller against Germany to clinch bronze.

That, perhaps more than anything, was the biggest surprise, taking into account the fact that medals are no guarantee in the final for such an unpredictable sport. Just like Rio 2016, India didn’t have a single medal in a discipline that has generally seen success for India at the international stage.Read more about the team’s performances here.

She started with successful lifts of 84kg and 87kg in the snatch to make the perfect start to her quest for a podium finish. A world record holder in clean and jerk in women’s 49kg category, Mirabai was in a good position to finish on the podium once she was in the top places after the snatch. The Indian made a successful attempt of 110 kg to start off Clean & Jerk before an incredible second lift of 115 kgShe became the second Indian to win an Olympic medal in weightlifting after Karnam Malleswari’s historic bronze in 2000 and just the fifth individual to win a silver medal.
