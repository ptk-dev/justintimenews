Upon his return from China, Muizzu had said that while the Maldives is a small country, it does not give anyone the licence to “bully” the island nation.On March 4, China signed a defence cooperation agreement with the Maldives that will provide the island nation with free military assistance, according to reports.This came nearly a month after the Maldives government announced that India had agreed to withdraw its military personnel from the island nation by May 10 and replace its aviation management staff located there with civilians.Also read:A decade under Modi: Aggressive foreign policy yields mixed returnsWhy a social media row over Modi’s tweets led to the suspension of three Maldives ministers?","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-04-08T14:43:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/175248-casydwitlh-1654167214.jpg","tags":["Mariyam Shiuna","Maldives","India","Ashoka Chakra"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1066376/suspended-maldivian-minister-apologises-after-row-over-social-media-post-featuring-ashoka-chakra"}
