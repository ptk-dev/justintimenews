It was founded and edited by Jawaharlal Nehru before he became India’s first prime minister.In April 2008, the paper suspended operations as it had incurred a debt of over Rs 90 crore. BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has accused Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi of setting up the Young Indian Private Limited firm to buy the debt using the funds from the Congress.In his complaint before a trial court, Swamy accused the Gandhis and others of conspiring to cheat and misappropriate the funds. He has alleged that the Young Indian firm paid only Rs 50 lakh to obtain the right to recover Rs 90.25 crore that the Associated Journals Limited owed to the Congress.The party had loaned the amount to Associated Journals Limited on an interest-free basis, according to court records. The Congress has claimed that there was no money exchange and only conversion of debt into equity took place to pay off dues like salaries.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-06-15T21:34:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/175828-ysfvyqceir-1655306379.jpg","tags":["Congress","Rahul Gandhi","National Herald","National Herald case","Enforcement Directorate","Delhi Police","Randeep Singh Surjewala"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1026254/800-congress-members-detained-for-protests-over-ed-summons-to-rahul-gandhi-delhi-police"}
