Do join us on Monday at 7.30pm IST when India take on Spain in their first match of the Rourkela leg of the Pro League.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India move to the fourth spot with this win while Ireland are now at the bottom of the table, still seeking their first win of the season. After keeping their defence up for the entirety of the match, Ireland are eventually let down as Gurjant breached through in the final minutes. India had created six penalty corner opportunities but had not been able to convert. The action now moves to Rourkela next. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India‚Äôs Gurjant Singh wins the Player of the Match award.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India 1-0 Ireland, Full-Time: India win 1-0 to snatch their second win of the season. Heartbreak for Ireland who put up a great defensive show for almost the entirety of the match. But Gurjant‚Äôs experience comes through in the 58th minute to take India across the line in what was a rather cagey match.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India 1-0 Ireland, Q3: GOAL India! And the deadlock is broken. Gurjant comes to the rescue for the homeside at the edge of the circle. In the last minute. What scenes! The Irish defence was resolute but it all falls apart in the final minute.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India 0-0 Ireland, Q3: Before this quarter, Ireland had no penalty corners to show. They have now earned three in this quarter! O‚Äô Donohughe attempts a strike but Sreejesh comes through with another great save. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India 0-0 Ireland, Q3: India lose their referral as Ireland are awarded the penalty corner ‚Äì their first of the game ‚Äì Sean Murray reversed the pass to Luke Madeley and his attempt is blocked but Ireland win a PC again. There is a goalmouth melee but Sreejesh and India clear their line. Meanwhile, Ireland is down to 10 players as Jeremy Duncan has been handed the green card.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India 0-0 Ireland, Q3: Sixth penalty corner opportunity.

India are looking for gaps with Manpreet using aerial balls and passes from the deep to force the issue but Ireland defend resolutely. With Akashdeep‚Äôs goal overturned by referral, India remain goalless. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India 0-0 Ireland, Q3: The first penalty corner opportunity in third quarter and India‚Äôs fourth in the game. Akashdeep passes it to Rohidas but it is saved by Carr. Another PC not converted. This is not stuff you hear often from India. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India 0-0 Ireland, Q3: Some concern for Ireland‚Äôs John McKee who has to walk off for medical attention after Harmanpreet runs into him. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India 0-0 Ireland, Q3: Abhishek passes towards Mandeep who deceives goalie Jamie Carr.
