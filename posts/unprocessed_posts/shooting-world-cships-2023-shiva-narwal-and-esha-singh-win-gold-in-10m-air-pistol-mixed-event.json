After finishing our first qualification relay we were not sure whether we would fight for gold but once we knew that we were in the gold match, we were confident of winning gold. Both of us had practiced together for finals at the Olympic range in Chateauroux, France last month.‚Äù Narwal was also thankful for the support of his brother Manish Narwal, who is also a Shooter and a Paralympic Games gold medallist. Highlighting the influence of his brother as a coach, Narwal said, ‚ÄúHe has been the most supportive. I just spoke to him after the final but could not speak much as the network was not good.‚ÄùNarwal and Singh shot 583 after 30 shots each in the first qualification relay. It was enough to be the best in both the relays combined as the experienced Turkish pairing of Dikec and Tarhan came second with 581. China won bronze defeating Iran in the bronze medal match after both teams had finished third and fourth in qualification.In the final, the Indian duo began better than Turkey winning both the first two single-shot series and taking a 4-0 lead in the first-to-16 race. In the third series, all four shooters shot in the 9s as the Turkish pair logged their first two points. A solid 10.6 in the fourth by Dikec saw Turkey draw level at 4-4. It was Tarhan‚Äôs turn to shoot a 10.7 in the fifth as Turkey took the lead at 6-4. Two solid 10s by the Indian teenagers in the sixth and seventh series and two shots in the 9s by the Turkish pair in the eighth, saw Singh and Narwal reclaim the lead at 10-6. Turkey then shot two shots in the 8-ring and two in the 9s as the Indians opened up a six-point gap at 14-8.Dikec and Tarhan remained in the contest to win the 12th series but in the final 13th series, Singh shot the highest 10.6 with Tarhan shooting the lowest 9.3, as India wrapped the match to become world champions.I cannot describe this feeling in words!
