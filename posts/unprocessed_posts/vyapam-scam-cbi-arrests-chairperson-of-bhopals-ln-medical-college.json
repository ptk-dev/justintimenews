{"title":"Vyapam scam: CBI arrests chairperson of Bhopal’s LN Medical College","content":"The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday arrested the chairperson of Bhopal’s LN Medical College in connection with the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board, or Vyapam, scam, PTI reported. The investigating agency said a special court had issued non-bailable arrest warrants against people named in its supplementary chargesheet.JN Chouksey was arrested from his house in Bhopal. “The arrested accused was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody up to March 24,” a CBI spokesperson said.In the supplementary chargesheet filed on November 23, 2017, the CBI claimed that the college had passed on incorrect information to the director of medical education in Bhopal. The agency said the college had informed the directorate of only five of over 40 vacant seats. “The medical college also took more than 40 admissions on September 30, 2012, when the process of counselling was already over,” the spokesperson alleged.The Vyapam scam refers to the alleged irregularities in various admission and job recruitment examinations conducted by the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board, also known as Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal, or Vyapam. Though FIRs in the scam had been filed from around 1995, the racket finally came to light in May 2012, when an invigilator at a test for veterinary colleges realised that one of the candidates was not who he claimed to be. On investigation, the police found a long trail of such scams spread across various districts in the state.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2018-03-22T17:13:16.710204+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/872944-72606-jxszqjfggv-1515156835.jpg","tags":["CBI","Vyapam","Madhya Pradesh","Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board","LN Medical College"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/872944/vyapam-scam-cbi-arrests-chairperson-of-bhopals-ln-medical-college"}
