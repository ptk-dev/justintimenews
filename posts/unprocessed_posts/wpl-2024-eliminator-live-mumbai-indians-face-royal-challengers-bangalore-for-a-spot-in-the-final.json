Although the defeat didn‚Äôt dent Mumbai‚Äôs hopes for qualifying, seeing as their win over Gujarat Giants ensured a spot in the knock-outs, it was sure to have rattled a few feathers in the Mumbai camp.This was also the Bangalore‚Äôs team first win against Mumbai in four matches, having lost the reverse fixture 10 days prior.The loss on March 12 saw uncharacteristic mistakes in fielding from the Mumbai Indians, while their middle order crumbled in the face of Perry extracting the perfect swing from the pitch.Although Shabnim Ismail also bowled in a similar manner, the Bangalore batters in Perry (again) and Ghosh had the benefit of chasing a below-par total.While Mumbai will want a shot at defending their title, Bangalore will be hoping for a repeat of Tuesday night when they walk out on the field tonight.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Screenshots via Jio Cinema","author":"Tanya Kini","time":"2024-03-15T18:45:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/199282-rxsvhhmyyj-1710506099.jpg","tags":["Mumbai Indians","Royal Challengers Bangalore","Women's Premier League","WPL 2024","Cricket","Harmanpreet Kaur","Smriti Mandhana"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1065264/wpl-2024-eliminator-live-mumbai-indians-face-royal-challengers-bangalore-for-a-spot-in-the-final"}
