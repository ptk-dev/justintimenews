He assured that the Election Commission would take required steps as per its ‚ÄúConstitutional position‚Äù to check the spread of the virus.On Thursday, Justice Shekhar Yadav of the Allahabad High Coirt had also requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately ban rallies and public meetings of political parties. While praising the prime minister for India‚Äôs vaccination drive, the judge urged him to take tougher measures to stop cases from rising.‚ÄúJaan hain toh jahan hain [if there is life, we have the world],‚Äù he said, reported Bar and Bench.The judge made the observations after pointing out that the High Court was regularly crowded as hundreds of cases were listed daily before him. Physical distancing norms, he said, were not followed by advocates even when Omicron variant was spreading across the country.

But, the poll panel claimed that it was too late to reduce the length of the elections.The Madras High Court too had pulled up the Election Commission, saying that it should be booked on charges of murder for allowing rallies to continue in poll-bound states.‚ÄúYour institution is singularly responsible for the second wave of the pandemic,‚Äù a bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy had told the Election Commission in April.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2021-12-24T19:41:00+05:30","image":"https://s02.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/53678-scssyoxsjh-1558596610.jpg","tags":["Uttar Pradesh","Election Commission","Omicron","Allahabad High Court","Assembly elections"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1013603/omicron-decision-on-holding-assembly-polls-after-up-visit-next-week-says-election-commission-chief"}
