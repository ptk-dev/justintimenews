Not quite sure who the cap went to but it wasn’t Amanjot Kaur certainly, who has already played for MI (but hasn’t been required to bat or bowl). MI’s bowlers have been brilliant in all three matches so far, bowling out their opponents thrice (29 wickets in all). UPW also have their bowlers coming to the party, especially spinners. Should be a good battle that today. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    Kids : Harmanpreet Kaur v Smriti Mandhana 😇😇Adults : Harmanpreet Kaur v Meg Lanning 🔥🔥Legends : Harmanpreet Kaur v Mithali Raj 😏😏Ultra Legends Pro Max : Harmanpreet Kaur v Alyssa Healy 🥵🥵#WPL2023#WPL | #TATAWPL | #CricketTwitter pic.twitter.com/RC6Uupdhuq— Krish (@archer_KC14) March 12, 2023\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Read: What a knock by Shafali Verma vs GG last night.WPL 2023: When Shafali Verma got Meg Lanning cheerleading\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    #WPL2023 When Shafali Verma had Meg Lanning cheerleading (and advising too)My piece (that took about three times longer to write than Shafali's innings):https://t.co/3UpWbnkdWx— Vinayakk (@vinayakkm) March 12, 2023\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    06.43 pm: The broadcasters do mention the “effort” debate that popped up recently on social media.

What's objective is effort Harmanpreet put to reach the crease. Purely mathematically speaking, her speed was fine to cover the distance left, before her bat got stuck, which is a variable where luck factors in.Also, empathy is not needed but would be nice. pic.twitter.com/0PNy1WAMb5— Vinayakk (@vinayakkm) February 26, 2023\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    06.40 pm Hello and welcome to the live coverage of Women’s Premier League. It’s match No 10 and it is UP Warriorz vs Mumbai Indians. It is Alyssa Healy vs Harmanpreet Kaur. Mumbai Indians have undoubtedly been the best side of the tournament so far and they come into this with three wins out of three. In what was supposed to be their biggest test so far, they came up with a thumping win against Delhi Capitals. They have won one match by 143 runs and finished two chases in the 15th over. On the other side, Healy’s Warriorz have blown hot and cold. They have two wins out of three, and their spin strength is starting to come to the fore. A win for them would see three teams emerge as clear favourites for top three. Will we see a close contest today?And watch out for the efforts on the field. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Photos / screenshots in the blog courtesy: Sportzpics / wplt20.com and JioCinema","author":"Vinayakk Mohanarangan","time":"2023-03-12T18:40:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/187871-hmmfmorkhs-1678643357.jpg","tags":["WPL 2023","Mumbai Indians","WPL","Harmanpreet Kaur","UP Warriorz","Alyssa Healy"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1045447/wpl-2023-up-warriorz-vs-mumbai-indians-live-score-updates-statistics-reactions-alyssa-healy-s-warriorz-vs-harmanpreet-kaur-s-mi"}
