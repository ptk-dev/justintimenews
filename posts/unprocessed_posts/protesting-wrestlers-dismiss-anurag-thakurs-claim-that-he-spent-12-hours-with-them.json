His officials were mediating with the players.”Phogat also echoed Punia’s allegations and said the sports minister didn’t even spend 12 minutes with the sportspersons. Phogat also alleged that the wrestlers were at times even intimidated during the meetings held to resolve the issue.#WATCH | Delhi: \"Sports Minister sat with athletes only for a few minutes...at times we were intimidated in the meeting...\": Protesting Wrestlers on Union Sports Minister's reaction on their protest against WFI chief & BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh https://t.co/mg2JdkZFSL pic.twitter.com/edzFF3BGrw— ANI (@ANI) April 27, 2023\n\nOn January 23, after the protests first began, the sports ministry had formed a oversight committee, headed by boxing legend MC Mary Kom, to investigate the allegations by the wrestlers.The committee was given a one-month deadline.
