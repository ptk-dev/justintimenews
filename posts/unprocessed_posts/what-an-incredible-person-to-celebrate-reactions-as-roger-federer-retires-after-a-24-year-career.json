{"title":"‘What an incredible person to celebrate’: Reactions as Roger Federer retires after a 24-year career","content":"Roger Federer promised his fans they had not seen the last of him  after bringing the curtain down on his glittering career, saying he  would see them on a “different type of tennis court” in future.The Swiss 20-time Grand Slam champion and Rafael Nadal lost their  Laver Cup doubles match 4-6, 7-6 (2), 11-9 to Team World’s Frances  Tiafoe and Jack Sock.The defeat for Europe left the two teams locked at two points apiece  after the first day of the Ryder Cup-style event at London’s O2 Arena.Roger Federer retires: Federer-Nadal go down in thriller, Swiss great bows out in emotional farewellBut the match itself was ultimately a sideshow on an emotional  occasion for the 41-year-old, who made a lengthy and tearful address to  the crowd, his rivals and family afterwards. “This is not the end-end, you know, life goes on,” he told a  post-match press conference in the early hours of Saturday, having  recovered the poise that was the hallmark of his career.“I’m healthy, I’m happy, everything’s great.“The message from me was just making sure I relay my passion for the  sport to the fans, and I let them know that hopefully we’ll see each  other again on a different type of tennis court somewhere around the  world,” he added.“I have no plans whatsoever, where, how, when. All I know, I would  love to go and play places I have never played before or go say thank  yous for years to come to all the people that have been so supportive of  me.”Federer, who had not played tennis competitively since Wimbledon in  2021 due to a knee injury, said at times during the build-up to the  match, which started late on Friday, he had been “horribly nervous”.“The last two days have been tough, you know, to say the least,” he  said. “Thankfully in moments I totally forgot about it, slept great,  everything was wonderful, I could enjoy it, I feel. “And because of that I think I will be able to have a better  recollection of how it went, because if it’s all just stress throughout  and I want it to be only perfect, I know I will remember half of it.”#ThankYouRoger “Dear Roger, my friend and rival. I wish this day would have never come,\" Nadal had tweeted.Tonight, they were both in tears. Sport will be really lucky to see another \"rivalry\" like this.https://t.co/oZaSlNOGYl pic.twitter.com/OSxfkj7O79— The Field (@thefield_in) September 23, 2022\n\n‘Super-emotional’Nadal also admitted it had been a tough day, with a “super-emotional” ending.“For me it has been a huge honour to be a part of this amazing moment  of the history of our sport, and at the same time a lot of years  sharing a lot of things together,” he said.“When Roger leaves the tour, an important part of my life is leaving too.”Federer and Nadal, who have won 42 Grand Slam singles titles between  them, spoke warmly of their friendship even though they have been fierce  rivals for nearly two decades.“It’s been great,” said the Swiss. “I think we enjoy each other’s  company, and we have so much to look back on, but also just enjoy  spending time together.“We have a million topics to cover. I always feel like any evening we ever spend together we never have enough time.”Nadal, 36, said his relationship with Federer had been a “super-long and positive journey”.“For me (Federer) was always the guy to beat,” said the Spaniard. “So at some  point we were probably the biggest rivals - I think always in a very  good way. “We respect a lot each other, families, teams. I mean, we never had  big issues... I mean, when we were getting older, I think every year the  personal relationship gets better and better.”“Very proud to be part of his career in some way,” he added. “But  even for me happier to finish our career like friends after everything  we shared on court like rivals.”(With AFP inputs)Here are some of the reactions on Twitter:Damn you Roger … will be walking around with swollen eyes for the whole weekend . 😢— Kim Clijsters (@Clijsterskim) September 23, 2022\n\nThis moment would not have been possible if Roger didn’t give me the opportunity to dream.
