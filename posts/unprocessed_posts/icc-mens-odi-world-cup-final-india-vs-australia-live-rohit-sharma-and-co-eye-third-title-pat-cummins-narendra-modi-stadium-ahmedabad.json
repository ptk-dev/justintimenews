{"title":"ICC Men‚Äôs ODI World Cup final, IND vs AUS, as it happened: Pat Cummins and Co win record sixth title","content":"That‚Äôs all from Scroll‚Äôs coverage of the ICC Men‚Äôs ODI World Cup final. Good night!India would have hoped to do one better than they did in 2003 when they faced Australia in the ICC World Cup final in Johannesburg. But it wasn‚Äôt to be as the men in gold spoiled the party in Ahmedabad as they romped home to a six-wicket win and clinched a record sixth title win to become the 2023 ICC Men‚Äôs ODI World Cup champions. The run chase was always going to be tricky and despite India‚Äôs best efforts with half-centuries from Virat Kohli and KL Rahul, the Australian bowlers led by Mitchell Starc and captain Pat Cummins were incredible in restricting the dynamic Indian batting line-up to 240 all out. Despite a quick-fire start that saw Australia fall to 47/3, the Indian bowlers were then overpowered by the grit and determination of Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne. Head took charge of the innings with his calm hitting and sensible strike rotation and Labuschagne was an able partner in the 192-run partnership that ultimately proved match-winning. After the horror start to Australia‚Äôs campaign that saw them beaten soundly by both India and South Africa, they redeemed themselves, beating both teams in the semi-finals and finals to remind the cricketing world of their title-winning experience and spirit. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    #CWC23Final #INDvAUSThe Australians know the drill!For a record sixth time, Australia are the ICC Men's ODI World Cup CHAMPIONS!üì∏ Disney+Hotstarhttps://t.co/N2ErlyQjQs pic.twitter.com/mNSwwNvplS‚Äî The Field (@thefield_in) November 19, 2023\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Travis Head wins the Player of the Match award for his scintillating century in the World Cup final.

Sharma plays the first ball with soft hands to guide it past slips. Charges down and whacks it through covers for the first four and follows it up with a heave down to the mid-wicket boundary.

Was going down the leg side all day long and keeper Josh Inglis gestures that it was going down. Australia show why they are the best fielding unit.
