However, BJP chief Amit Shah claimed that the party had fielded Thakur against Digvijaya Singh because he was the person who coined the terms “Hindu terror” and “saffron terror”. Shah said the BJP had taken the matter to the “people court”, PTI reported. BJP leader Subramanian Swamy claimed that Thakur had been a “victim of the Congress agenda”. He said that Thakur was innocent and devoted to religion, and added that the charges against her in the Malegaon blasts case were “in the final stages of being dismissed”.On September 29, 2008, at least six people died and several were injured in two blasts in Maharashtra’s Malegaon. Thakur is one of the accused in the case. She has been charged under Section 18 (conspiracy) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and other sections of the Indian Penal Code. Currently, she is out on bail.Thakur, who is known for her incendiary comments and speeches, had been associated with the radical Hindu outfit Abhinav Bharat and Durga Vahini, which is the women’s wing of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2019-04-17T21:19:07.547093+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/50561-gahyxekkjq-1555514713.jpeg","tags":["Mehbooba Mufti","Bharatiya Janata Party","Pragya Singh Thakur"]}
