{"title":"Pause, rewind, play: Milkha Singh‚Äôs iconic sprint at the Rome Olympics","content":"For decades, India has been used to heartbreaks at the Olympic Games. And among those, essays could be written just about the country‚Äôs famous fourth-placed finishes that were inspiring and agonising in equal measures. PT Usha‚Äôs in 1984. Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi‚Äôs in 2004. Dipa Karmakar and Abhinav Bindra‚Äôs in 2016. And perhaps the most iconic of them all: when the world witnessed a remarkable 400m men‚Äôs final at the 1960 Rome Olympics that saw Milkha Singh finish a whisker behind the bronze medal position. The legendary athlete is a four-time Asian Games gold medallist and the 1958 Commonwealth Games champion, but his greatest performance was the fourth-place finish in Rome. For world athletics, the men‚Äôs 400m event at the Rome 1960 Olympic Games was extraordinary because USA‚Äôs Otis Davis and Germany‚Äôs Carl Kaufmann set a new world record in a photo-finish. Imagine that, not one but two racers giving the best the world has seen on the same day.  The two men were hand-timed at 44.9 secs to smash the then four-year-old world record of 45.2 second. The auto-timing then showed that Davis had won 45.07 to 45.08.But a few yards behind, there was another close finish. Milkha Singh, the Flying Sikh, had started the race in fantastic fashion. He was the reigning Commonwealth Games champion in the 440-yards. He was clocking superb timings in the lead up to the event. And he looked good for a medal half way throught. But the trailblazing Indian missed out on a bronze medal. Participating in the 400 metres final and touted as a medal contender, Singh paid the price for a slight misjudgement to be pushed to fourth at the finish by South Africa‚Äôs Malcolm Spence, by mere 1/10th of a second. Officially, Singh was 0.13 seconds behind bronze medallist Spence and 0.67 seconds behind US winner Davis.Breaking the World Record 56 years apart #tbt #400m Rome 1960 - Rio 2016 @TeamUSA @WaydeDreamer @TeamSA18 @omegawatches #omegaofficialtimekeeper pic.twitter.com/kLOFrhqKpC‚Äî Olympics (@Olympics) January 31, 2019\n\nAt the 1960 Rome @Olympics, Otis Davis was the first man to break 45 seconds in the 400m when he won ü•á in a new üåé record time of 44.9.

I knew what my fatal error was: After running perilously fast in lane five, I slowed down at 250 metres. I could not cover the lost ground after that ‚Äì and that cost me the race. After the death of my parents, that is my worst memory. I kept crying for days.‚ÄùAccording to World Athletics, Singh had set the then national record of 45.6 seconds which was hand-timed, but the race was also timed by a completely automatic electric system and was subsequently established by this system to be 45.73. And that mark stood for nearly four decades, to be broken in 1998. ‚ÄúMilkha‚Äôs story of a bronze missed in Rome 1960, is the most irresistible [among India‚Äôs Olympic Games stories], the one we return to constantly. Perhaps because heartbreak, as a story, is often more powerful, and poignant, than triumph,‚Äù sports writer Rohit Brijnath wrote for BBC News in 2008.
