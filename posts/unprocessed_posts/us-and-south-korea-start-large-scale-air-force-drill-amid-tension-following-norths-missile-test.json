The drill includes the participation of more than 230 aircraft. Pyongyang has condemned the drill and described it as a provocation. North Korea will “seriously consider” responding to the drill and the United States and South Korea will “pay dearly for their provocations,” The New York Times quoted a report from Pyongyang’s Central News Agency as saying.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had “declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force”.
