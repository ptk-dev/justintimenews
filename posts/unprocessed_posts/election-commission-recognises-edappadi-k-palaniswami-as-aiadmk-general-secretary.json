A single bench of Justice G Jayachandran had ruled on August 17 that the July 11 general council meeting general council meeting was invalid. In his order, Jayachandran had held that any general council meeting in future should be convened jointly by both leaders.However, on September 2, a division bench of the Madras High Court set aside the single judge order.
