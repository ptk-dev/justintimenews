Chidambaram, who has been questioned earlier in relation to the case, has been summoned by the Directorate in the first week of September.The lawyer was originally asked to appear before the Central Bureau of Investigation in relation with a sum of money paid to her for drafting a contract for Manoranjana Sinh, the estranged wife of former Union Minister Matang Sinh, who is also being examined by the CBI. The investigating agency had named Chidambaram in its sixth supplementary charge-sheet after former Saradha Chairman and Managing Director Sudipto Sen mentioned her in a “tell all” letter to the Bureau.  Sen had claimed that Chidambaram was paid Rs 1 crore as her legal fees.However, the advocate has not been named as an accused or a witness in the case, but as a person privy to certain information regarding the deal. Chidambaram’s team has denied that she was questioned by the CBI in the matter. The lawyer is the wife of former Union Finance Minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram. Matang Sinh, Sen and businessman Santanu Ghosh along with their companies have been charged with criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal breach of trust over the loss of thousands of crores of investor money in the Ponzi scheme, which collapsed in 2013.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2016-08-24T12:56:20.746570+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/814778-40049-dguroafumu-1472023538.jpg","tags":["India","Saradha scam","Nalini Chidambaram","Sudipta Sen","Matang Sinh","Santanu Ghosh"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/814778/ed-issues-summons-to-nalini-chidambaram-over-saradha-scam-after-accused-sudipta-sen-names-her"}
