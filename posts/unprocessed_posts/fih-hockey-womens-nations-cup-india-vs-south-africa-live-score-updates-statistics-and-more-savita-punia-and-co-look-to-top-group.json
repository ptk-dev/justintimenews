Ireland will now face India, while Japan will take on Spain, in the semifinals on 16 December.¬†Ireland played in the opening fixture of the day and held a 2-0 lead against Korea with just 7 minutes to go, but a late flurry from Korea earned them a 2-2 draw and Ireland had to wait for the result in the second game of the day between Spain and Italy to know their fate.¬†Italy played a brilliant defensive game to keep Spain at bay throughout the game before trying to look for a late winner that would‚Äôve taken them above Ireland on goal difference, but they couldn‚Äôt break the resolute Spanish defense, and the draw gave them a 3rd place finish ahead of Korea, with Ireland finishing second.¬†India maintained their perfect record, making it 3 wins out of 3, with a dominant display against the young South African team, with defenders Deep Grace Ekka and Gurjit Kaur getting on the scoreboard through well taken penalty corner goals.¬†The final game of the pool stages was played between Chile and Japan. Chile needed a win to overtake Japan in Pool B, while Japan needed to at least draw the game, to stay ahead of Chile on goal difference. The teams went into the half tied at 1 goal each, and the Japanese defense proved to be a fortress that Chile could not breach in the second half, with the game ending in a tie that sent Japan through to the semifinals.¬†‚Äî via FIH\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Semifinal lineup: India will face Ireland, while Spain will take on Japan. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n     Goal-scoring progress: IND vs RSA \n    \n       Team  Minute  Player  Action  Score \n    \n     India  14  Ekka Deep Grace  Penalty Corner  1 - 0  India  59  Kaur Gurjit  Penalty Corner  2 - 0 \n   vis TMS \n\n    Full-Time: India 2-0 South Africa Dominant India make it 3 wins out of 3 in the #FIHNations Cup to seal the top position of Pool B and set up a semifinal clash against Ireland.üì≤ Watch every game live on https://t.co/igjqkvhUYl.
