It was withdrawn on July 30, 2022, with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena recommending an investigation into the alleged irregularities of the policy.The Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate have alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party government modified Delhi’s liquor excise policy to ensure a 12% profit margin for wholesalers and a nearly 185% profit margin for retailers.The Enforcement Directorate has also claimed that members of a “South Group” had paid at least Rs 100 crore in kickbacks to leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party through businessman Vijay Nair, who is currently in jail.Hours before Kejriwal’s arrest on March 20, electoral bond data released by the Election Commission had shown a company linked to another person accused in the same case, P Sarath Chandra Reddy, had donated Rs 5 crore to the BJP in 2022, just five days after he was taken in custody. Another Rs 25 crore was donated to the BJP after Reddy turned approver in the case.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-04-01T12:26:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/189164-aikacbezhp-1681629139.jpg","tags":["Arvind Kejriwal","Delhi liquor policy case","Delhi"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1066057/arvind-kejriwal-sent-to-judicial-custody-till-april-15-in-liquor-policy-case"}
