If Gukesh beat Nakamura, he would have won the tournament outright. If he played out a draw against Nakamura and one of Caruana and Nepomniachtchi emerged victorious, Gukesh would have had to play a tiebreaker with the winner of the Caruana and Nepomniachtchi match.Despite playing in the black against the seasoned Nakamura, Gukesh played out a comfortable draw without handing his opponent any chances.On the other table, Caruana and Nepomniachtchi also played out a 109-move draw, handing Gukesh a memorable victory.‚ÄúI am so relieved and so happy. Following this crazy game (Caruana-Nepomniachtchi), I was completely emotional. Now I am feeling quite good,‚Äù Gukesh said.Gukesh won five matches, drew eight and lost just the solitary match in the tournament.Gukesh had become the third youngest player to compete in a Candidates tournament after Bobby Fischer and Magnus Carlsen. At 17, the Indian has become the youngest player to win the tournament and has become the second Indian after Viswanathan Anand to compete in the World Championship in the classical format.Gukesh will take on reigning World Champion Ding Liren of China with a shot at becoming the youngest World Champion in history.Congratulations to @DGukesh for becoming the youngest challenger. The @WacaChess family is so proud of what you have done . I‚Äôm personally very proud of how you played and handled tough situations. Enjoy the moment‚Äî Viswanathan Anand (@vishy64theking) April 22, 2024\n\n\nWhat an evening ü´£Congratulations  to Gukesh and special award for both Fabi, Ian for their increadible performance today.
