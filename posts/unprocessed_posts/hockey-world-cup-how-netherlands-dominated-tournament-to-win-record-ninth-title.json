{"title":"FIH Hockey Women’s World Cup: Netherlands extend incredible dominance with ninth title","content":"The Netherlands retained the FIH Women’s Hockey World Cup in style by beating Argentina 3-1 in the final on Sunday. The Dutch hockey was powerful, compelling and utterly unstoppable. It gave the Oranje their ninth title – with Eva de Goede, Xan de Waard, Marloes Keetels, Margot van Geffen and Lidewij Welten all receiving their third World Cup gold medal.Heading into the fifteenth edition of the World Cup, Netherlands were the reigning champions and had won more women’s World Cups than any other nation. With the win over Argentina in 2022, they have claimed the title on nine occasions. Netherlands' road to ninth World Cup title \n    \n       Round  Opponent  Result \n    \n     Final  Argentina  Won 3-1  Semifinal  Australia  Won 1-0  Quarterfinal  Belgium  Won 2-1  Pool A  Chile   Won 3-1  Pool A  Germany  Won 3-1  Pool A  Ireland  Won 5-1 \n  The Oranje squad was boosted by the surprise return to fitness of all-time great Eva de Goede, a player who suffered cruciate ligament damage towards the end of last year, an injury most felt ended her hopes of competing. De Goede’s presence was a valuable asset to a team, her creativity shining through often times in their chase for a ninth World Cup titleNetherlands player Laura Nunnink had said before the tournament: “We are always expected to win and anything less than Gold is not good enough for us. But it’s also a drive for us to be there all the time, to keep improving our game and make sure we stay on top. So, it’s a pressure but it’s also something that drives us to be better.”And they did just that.

With a squad packed with some of the world’s most iconic players – including Frederique Matla, Xan de Waard and Lidewij Welten – there was every chance of them doing just that.The team had parted company with hugely successful head coach Alyson Annan following their Olympic gold medal winning performance at the delayed Tokyo 2020 Games but the team that was currently being overseen by revered coach Jamilon Mülders – the man who took Germany women to the Olympic bronze medal at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 – also lived up to it its reputation.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-07-18T14:56:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/177283-melgdfpnet-1658135446.jpeg","tags":["FIH Women's Hockey World Cup","Netherlands","Argentina","Women's hockey world cup","Hockey"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1028478/hockey-world-cup-how-netherlands-dominated-tournament-to-win-record-ninth-title"}
