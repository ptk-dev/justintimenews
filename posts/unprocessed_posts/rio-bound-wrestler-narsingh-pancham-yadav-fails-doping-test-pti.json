His B sample was also found to be positive,\" NADA Director General Navin Agarwal said. \"He appeared before a disciplinary panel on Saturday. The panel sought for more reports regarding the matter. We will proceed further, and I am hoping that the panel will proceed quickly. Till then, we will have to wait.\"However, Agarwal preferred to not comment on whether the wrestler will miss the Olympics, saying it was \"too early\". A release from the Press Information Bureau also confirmed that a wrestler had tested positive for a doping test, and a hearing was underway. But it did not mention the identity of the wrestler.Yadav later denied having taken any banned substance, saying it was a conspiracy to prevent him from competing at the Rio Olympics. \"I'm sure the  truth will come out. The Indian Olympic Association will support me,\"  he said.The wrestler underwent a doping test administered by NADA on July 5, NDTV reported. As a precautionary measure, the Wrestling Federation of India prevented Yadav from travelling to Georgia with the other Indian wrestlers for a training programme and also recalled his Olympics accreditation card.Earlier this year, wrestler and Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar had expressed his displeasure at the Wrestling Federation of India's decision to send 26-year-old Yadav to the Olympics. Though Yadav had booked a quota place for India at the 2015 Wrestling Championships, Kumar called for a bout between them to decide India's representative and took the matter to the judiciary, which ruled against him.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2016-07-24T11:05:30.881514+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/812363-38130-gyqikwsuun-1469335469.jpg","tags":["Wrestling","Narsingh Yadav","Rio Olympics"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/812363/rio-bound-wrestler-narsingh-pancham-yadav-fails-doping-test-pti"}
