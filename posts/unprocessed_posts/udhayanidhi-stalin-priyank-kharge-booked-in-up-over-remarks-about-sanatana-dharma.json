In the same way, we have to eradicate sanatana [dharma], rather than opposing it.”Stalin later denied that he called for a genocide of Hindus. He claimed that sanatana dharma is a principle that divides people in the basis of caste and religion and that uprooting it would symbolise upholding humanity and human equality.On September 4, Kharge supported Stalin’s statement and said: “Any religion that does not promote equality or does not ensure you have the dignity of being human is not religion, according to me... Any religion that does not give equal rights or does not treat you like humans is as good as disease.”The Bharatiya Janata Party had alleged that the Tamil Nadu minister was calling for a “genocide” of Hindus.#WATCH | Bengaluru, Karnataka: On  Tamil Nadu Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin's 'Sanatana Dharma should be eradicated' remark, Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge says, \"Any religion that does not promote equality or does not ensure you have the dignity of being human is not religion,… pic.twitter.com/lQcpB5s6aY— ANI (@ANI) September 4, 2023\n\nTamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai, however, accused Udhayanidhi Stalin of peddling a “bought-out idea from Christian missionaries”.“The idea of those missionaries was to cultivate dimwits like you to parrot their malicious ideology,” Annamalai wrote. “Tamil Nadu is a land of spiritualism. The best you can do is to hold a mic in an event like this and rant out your frustration.”Union Home Minister said that Stalin’s remarks showed that the Opposition’s INDIA alliance “hates Hinduism” and that the statement was “an attack on our heritage”.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-09-06T13:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/193827-tyemxsilxr-1693984532.jpg","tags":["Udhayanidhi Stalin","Priyank Kharge","Sanatana Dharma","Tamil Nadu"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1055521/udhayanidhi-stalin-priyank-kharge-booked-in-up-over-remarks-about-sanatana-dharma"}
