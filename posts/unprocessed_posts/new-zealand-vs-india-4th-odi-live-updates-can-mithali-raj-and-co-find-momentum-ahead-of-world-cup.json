The match became an effective T20 due to rain as Amelia Kerr stole the show with a 33-ball-68 which took New Zealand to 191 for 5. She then mopped up the tail with 3 for 30 as India managed only 128 before being all-out in 17.5 overs.Teenager Richa Ghosh‚Äôs counter-attacking 52 off 29 balls was the only silver lining in an otherwise forgettable performance for India which has now led to five defeats on this tour including the one-off T20. Her half century is now the fastest scored by an Indian woman in ODIs. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    A record-breaking knock deserves some special praise! üëè üëèHere's what #TeamIndia all-rounder @Deepti_Sharma06 had to say about @13richaghosh üé• üîΩ #NZWvINDW pic.twitter.com/CpX89TVKgF‚Äî BCCI Women (@BCCIWomen) February 22, 2022\n\nRicha Ghosh scored the fastest ODI century by an Indian woman \n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Player of the match: Huge surprise.
