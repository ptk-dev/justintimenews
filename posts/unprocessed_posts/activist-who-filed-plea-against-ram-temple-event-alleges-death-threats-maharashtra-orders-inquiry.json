{"title":"Activist who filed plea against Ram temple event alleges death threats, Maharashtra orders inquiry","content":"Social activist Saket Gokhale on Friday sought assistance from the Maharashtra government after alleged members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh showed up outside his home in Mumbai and started chanting ‚ÄúJai Shri Ram‚Äù slogans.Earlier in the day, Gokhale had said that he was ‚Äúgetting death threats on the phone from BJP & RSS workers‚Äù after he appeared on a news channel to oppose the ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of the Ram temple in Uttar Pradesh‚Äôs Ayodhya city on August 5 in the wake of the the coronavirus crisis.Home Minister Anil Deshmukh took note of Gokhale‚Äôs tweets and assured him protection. Soon after, Gokhale announced on Twitter that the Thane police had filed an FIR and also provided him protection. Gokhale had moved the Allahabad High Court seeking a restraining order on the bhoomi poojan or ground-breaking ceremony for the Ram temple. He had argued that around 300 people would gather at a single location, which was likely to violate physical distancing guidelines prescribed by both the Centre and the state government to stop the coronavirus from spreading. However, the High Court dismissed his petition on Friday.Hours after the verdict, Gokhale tweeted a video that showed a group of four to five men walking around his residential complex and shouting ‚ÄúBolo Jai Shri Ram‚Äù. The activist said the alleged members of the RSS, which is the ideological wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party, also threatened his mother. ‚ÄúRequest urgent assistance,‚Äù Gokhale tweeted, tagging the official Twitter handle of Deshmukh and the Thane Police.So after appearing on @ZeeNews this morning & saying that the Ram Mandir Bhumi Puja event in the middle of a pandemic is risky, I‚Äôve started getting death threats on the phone from BJP & RSS workers. One of them said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see our anger now‚Äù. This is how @AmitShah operates.‚Äî Saket Gokhale (@SaketGokhale) July 24, 2020\n\n.@SaketGokhale We are taking very serious cognisance of this and have immediately ordered an enquiry into this issue.

Giri added that 200 people, including 150 invitees, would be allowed to see the rituals. The prime minister will set a silver brick into the ground as a symbolic gesture of breaking the ground.  In a landmark verdict on November 9 last year, the Supreme Court had ruled that the disputed land in Ayodhya would be handed over to a government-run trust for the construction of a Ram temple. The court said that the demolition of Babri Masjid was illegal and directed the government to acquire an alternative plot of land to build a mosque.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2020-07-24T21:02:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/144940-hisbolhrsb-1595599395.jpg","tags":["Saket Gokhale","Allahabad High Court","RSS","Ayodhya","Ayodhya Verdict","Anil Deshmukh"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/968474/activist-who-filed-plea-against-ram-temple-event-alleges-death-threats-maharashtra-orders-inquiry"}
