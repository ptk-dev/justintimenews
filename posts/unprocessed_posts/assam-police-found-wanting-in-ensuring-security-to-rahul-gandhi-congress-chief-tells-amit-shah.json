They have been booked for “wanton acts of violence”.Earlier on Tuesday, Sarma directed the police to file a case after Congress workers broke barricades and shouted slogans upon being stopped from entering Guwahati during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-01-24T16:16:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190914-vzkregpynb-1685953142.jpg","tags":["Mallikarjun Kharge","Amit Shah","Assam","Rahul Gandhi"]}
