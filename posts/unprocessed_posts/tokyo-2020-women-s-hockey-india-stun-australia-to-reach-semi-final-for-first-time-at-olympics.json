Australia won two late PCs but India had bodies on the line to clear the danger every time.Reaching the semi-finals is a historic achievement for the ninth-ranked India who had qualified for their first Olympics in 36 years at Rio in 2016.India will face Argentina in the semi-final on August 4.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2021-08-02T10:09:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/162292-cksxoihweb-1627879051.jpg","tags":["Hockey","Indian hockey team","Gurjit Kaur","Olympics","Tokyo Olympics","Olympics 2020","Indian Hockey"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1001748/tokyo-2020-women-s-hockey-india-stun-australia-to-reach-semi-final-for-first-time-at-olympics"}
