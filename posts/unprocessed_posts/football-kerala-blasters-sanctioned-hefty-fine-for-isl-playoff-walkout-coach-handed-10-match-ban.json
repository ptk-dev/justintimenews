{"title":"Football: Kerala Blasters sanctioned hefty fine for ISL playoff walkout, coach handed 10-match ban","content":"The Disciplinary Committee of the All India Football Federation,  chaired by Vaibhav Gaggar on Friday, imposed a fine  of Rs 4 crores on Kerala Blasters FC for walking  off the pitch and thereby forfeiting their Indian Super League  playoff match against Bengaluru FC at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium in  Bengaluru on March 3.The AIFF Disciplinary Committee, after hearing all parties involved  in the tie and considering their protests and submissions, said that  Kerala Blasters are “also directed to issue a ‘Public Apology’ for this  unsporting conduct of abandoning the match, failing which the total fine  to be imposed on the Defendant team will be increased to Rs 6 crores.”Kerala Blasters’ actions came after a hotly disputed goal scored by  Bengaluru FC from a free-kick. The club filed a protest to the AIFF  against referee Crystal John’s decision to allow the goalscorer Sunil  Chhetri to take the free-kick that resulted in the goal.ISL: Chhetri’s cheeky goal, KBFC’s crazy walkout – how an incredible night unfolded in Bengaluru  Kerala Blasters head coach Ivan Vukomanovic, who was accused of  the offence of abandonment and bringing the game into disrepute, and  apparently instigated the team for discontinuing the encounter, has been  penalised “with a 10-match ban/suspension from AIFF held tournaments  irrespective of whichever team he is contracted with, along with a fine  of Rs 5 lakh under Article 9.1.2 (of the AIFF  disciplinary code).”The Disciplinary Committee further stated, “This would necessarily  mean that the Head Coach shall not be permitted to be a part of the team  dressing room and/or the team bench as per Article 9.1.6. the Head  Coach is also directed to issue a ‘Public Apology’ for his misconduct,  failing which the total fine to be imposed on the Head Coach will be  increased to Rs 10 lakh along with the  aforementioned ban/ suspension for 10 matches and from being a part of  the team dressing room and team bench, irrespective of the team he is  contracted with.”The Committee has directed both Kerala Blasters and Vukomanovic to  comply with this order within one week. However, Kerala Blasters and  their Head Coach have the right to file an appeal against the Order.The Committee also noted that “abandonment of a game is one of the  rarest occurrences in global sporting history, especially in Football.  In India, this is only the second time in professional football recorded  history that a team has abandoned a match. The only other time such an  act occurred was in the match of East Bengal vs Mohun Bagan on December 9, 2012.“In that match, Mohun Bagan was a goal down against bitter rivals  East Bengal in Kolkata when a stone hurled from one of the stands hit  midfielder Syed Rahim Nabi. The match resumed after a 13-minute stoppage  towards the end of the first half, but Mohun Bagan refused to take the  field after the interval as the midfielder Nabi was treated for a  fractured jaw and Mohun Bagan players still felt insecure and in danger,” the committee observed.“Despite having such a probable cause of abandoning the match, Mohun  Bagan were stripped of all the 12 points they had earned so far in the  league season at that time and had been fined Rs 2 crore,” the  committee added.Update:We will come back stronger together💛🔵💛 pic.twitter.com/OLVcfL5WpU— Ivan Vukomanovic (@ivanvuko19) April 2, 2023\n\n𝗖𝗹𝘂𝗯 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.#ഒന്നായിപോരാടാം #KBFC #KeralaBlasters pic.twitter.com/l7EmDNYhEG— Kerala Blasters FC (@KeralaBlasters) April 2, 2023","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-04-01T09:28:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/187554-nfxuxqydmr-1677863182.jpg","tags":["AIFF Disciplinary Committee","Bengaluru FC","Kerala Blasters","Ivan Vukomanovic","All India Football Federation","AIFF","Sunil Chhetri","Walkoff"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1046636/football-kerala-blasters-sanctioned-hefty-fine-for-isl-playoff-walkout-coach-handed-10-match-ban"}
