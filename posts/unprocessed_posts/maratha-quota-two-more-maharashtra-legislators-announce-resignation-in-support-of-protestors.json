Hemant Patil and Hemant Godse belong to Shinde’s Shiv Sena faction.The Marathas are a group of clans, historically comprising peasants and warriors but generally with an agrarian background. The community has demanded quotas in education and government jobs for decades, citing a decline in financial stability following agrarian distress. A series of massive protests were organised to press for the demand in 2017 and 2018.These demands for Maratha quota resurfaced in recent months with activist Manoj Jarange-Patil launching a fresh agitation for the cause in September.On October 25, Jarange-Patil started a hunger strike at the Antarwali Sarati village in Jalna district after the 40-day deadline he had given to the Maharashtra government to implement the Maratha quota expired.#WATCH | Maharashtra | Maratha reservation agitators set fire to the NCP office in Beed City earlier this evening.
