We were at our lowest low in Singapore, morale was low. But we stood up from there and this week has been incredible and still a match to go. I hope we will be able to take the title.‚ÄùHS Prannoy after his defeat against world No 1 Viktor Axelsen:‚ÄúI made a lot of errors in the lifts. Physically I was all right. It was just about finding the right length, trying to get to the lines, especially in this kind of drift. Viktor is consistent in finding the right length.‚ÄùViktor Axelsen on reaching the final on his injury comeback:‚ÄúI was actually really surprised. I never thought I‚Äôd be in a final after the lead-up to this tournament. I literally started practising five days before coming here, so I had no expectations. I only wanted to play without pain, and now to be in the final, winning every match in straight games, is amazing. I‚Äôm really relaxed going into the final tomorrow, I will just enjoy the experience.‚ÄúI lost to Prannoy at the HSBC BWF World Tour Finals and I wanted to see if I could do better today, and yeah, today I won in straight games. I was under pressure in the second game as I was in the first game but I stepped up in the end. His attack was really good. He‚Äôs a talented player, has been playing really well.

But we‚Äôre still hungry and we want to go all the way.‚ÄúAfter Swiss Open and after the Asian Championships, we were on a 10-match winning streak ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt say we were not hungry at all, but there was slight dip. A few matches here and there and suddenly the confidence went down.‚ÄúThe Singapore Open was one of those matches when we felt really bad, after going out in the first round, and we knew we had to come back, and from then on we pushed as hard as possible in the one week we got, in training.
