RCB once again had a good start but nothing much else. It is hard to imagine them coming back into the tournament here, four defeats is one thing but the NRR is so bad that it is, in my book, all but over for top three hopes.

It‚Äôs match No 8 and it is getting dangerously close to exit territory for Royal Challengers Bangalore. And they take on Alyssa Healy‚Äôs UP Warriorz.Their Net Run Rate is bad, they are yet to win a match after playing three, and a defeat tonight will all but seal their fate in the inaugural edition of WPL. RCB began the tournament as one of the strongest teams on paper but they are yet to come to the party. Worryingly for them, the margins have been big too. But they did show signs of finding somewhat close to their best in the defeat against Gujarat Giants. For UPW, the stunning heist against GG was followed by a big defeat against Delhi Capitals despite a stunning 90* by Tahlia McGrath. They took a big risk by dropping Grace Harris to prop up their bowling, but expect the explosive batter to return to the lineup today at Brabourne Stadium.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Photos / screenshots in the blog courtesy: Sportzpics / wplt20.com and JioCinema","author":"Vinayakk Mohanarangan","time":"2023-03-10T18:40:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/187809-vuxxiccawq-1678468305.jpg","tags":["UPW vs RCB","WPL 2023","WPL","Smriti Mandhana","Alyssa Healy"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1045384/wpl-2023-up-warriorz-vs-royal-challengers-bangalore-live-scores-statistics-reactions-smriti-mandhana-and-co-seek-first-win-take-on-alyssa-healy-s-team"}
