{"title":"A lion-hearted cricketer: Reactions as Yashpal Sharma, one of the heroes of 1983, dies","content":"India’s 1983 World Cup hero Yashpal Sharma died on Tuesday after suffering a massive cardiac arrest. He was 66 and is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.In his international career, Sharma played 37 Tests, scoring 1606 runs (avg 33.45), and 42 ODIs in which he scored 883.In the Test arena, despite having all the shots in his repertoire, he often put them away for the sake of the team. He was, in the words of many, a man for a crisis. His determination and concentration were of a very high level.In the ODI arena, he was known for his gutsy attitude and his stroke-filled half century in the semifinal against England in the 1983 campaign at Old Trafford will forever be etched in the public memory.Here are some reactions to his death:Shocked and deeply pained by the demise of Yashpal Sharma ji. Have fond memories of watching him bat during the 1983 World Cup. His contribution to Indian cricket shall always be remembered.My sincere condolences to the entire Sharma family. pic.twitter.com/WBQ6ng2x8I— Sachin Tendulkar (@sachin_rt) July 13, 2021\n\nDeeply saddening news.

Interviewed him only a few weeks ago. Yashpal set the tone for the triumph with a match winning innings against the West Indies in the very first game of the tournament. Tough, combative player.

My deepest condolences to the family and friends. #OmShanti— Pragyan Ojha (@pragyanojha) July 13, 2021\n\nIf current Indian batsmen are celebrated for their audacity, it was Yashpal Sharma who set the trend with his 2 audacious sixes in the 1983 World Cup semi. Making room & launching Paul Allott over long off. Walking across & whipping Bob Willis over deep backward square leg #RIP— Bharat Sundaresan (@beastieboy07) July 13, 2021","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2021-07-13T12:08:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/161490-anwrosilpn-1626156126.jpeg","tags":["Yashpal Sharma","Cricket","India"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1000069/a-lion-hearted-cricketer-reactions-as-yashpal-sharma-one-of-the-heroes-of-1983-dies"}
