For months now, they have been at loggerheads with the state government, and, in particular with Singh, who the community claims harbours Meitei “majoritarian” sentiments.On May 24, a mob had vandalised the home of state minister Govindas Konthoujam in the Ningthoukhong Bazaar area of Bishnupur. The same day a man succumbed to bullet injuries while he was being taken to a hospital in Bishnupur district.Two days later, a mob, largely led by members of the Meitei community, had attacked the home of Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Education RK Ranjan Singh to express their anger against the violence that took place a day ago. The Union minister also belongs to the Meitei community.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-05-31T10:19:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190765-botlgyyfuz-1685505630.jpg","tags":["Manipur","Manipur violence","Amit Shah"]}
