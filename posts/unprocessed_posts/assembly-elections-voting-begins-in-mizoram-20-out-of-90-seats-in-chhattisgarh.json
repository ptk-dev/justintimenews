On Friday, the BJP had promised that it will procure paddy at Rs 3,100 per quintal if it comes to power in the state in the upcoming Assembly election. The Congress government in the state currently purchases the crop at Rs 2,600 per quintal, a price that is already the highest in the country. However, after the saffron party upped the ante, the Congress promised that farmers would get Rs 3,200 for every quintal of paddy. The amount will include an input subsidy under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojana, the manifesto said.The BJP, meanwhile, has urged Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel to respond to allegations by the Enforcement Directorate that he accepted bribes of at least Rs 508 crore from illegal betting website Mahadev Book.
