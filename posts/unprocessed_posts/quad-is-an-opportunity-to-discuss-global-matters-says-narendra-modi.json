After the crisis, India was looking to export a record one crore tonnes of wheat in 2022-2023.Also read:After 70 years of ties and a rising China, it is time for India and Japan to strike a defence dealUkraine crisis: India’s response to Russian attack ‘somewhat shaky’, says US President Joe Biden","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-05-22T18:09:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/174718-boeimrcewr-1653219354.jpg","tags":["Quad Leaders’ Summit","Prime Minister Narendra Modi","Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese","US President Joe Biden","Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1024509/quad-is-an-opportunity-to-discuss-global-matters-says-narendra-modi"}
