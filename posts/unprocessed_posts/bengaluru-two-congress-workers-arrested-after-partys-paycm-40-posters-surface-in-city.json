Ministers, MLAs are also involved.”The BJP, however, rejected the charges by accusing the contractors association of being linked to the Congress.On Wednesday, the police arrested Karnataka Congress social media coordinator BR Naidu and Congress IT cell member Gagan Yadav for allegedly pasting the posters.The police along with civic authorities removed the “PayCM” posters from Mekhri Circle, Palace Road, and Balekundri Circle.Congress MLA Priyank Kharge asked the Bommai-led government to address the bribery allegations, The Telegraph reported.“They can tear the posters, hack our website and Twitter handles and even issue summons,” Kharge added. “But tell us when they are going to explain to the people about this rate card.”Bommai said he has ordered an inquiry as the poster campaign was a conspiracy to tarnish his and the Karnataka government’s reputation.“Everyone knows how to launch baseless campaigns like this one,” the chief minister said. “But my issue is that this is an attempt to spoil the name of the state and suitable action will follow against that.”","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-09-22T12:24:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/180249-rxdqgkjphg-1663825307.jpg","tags":["PayCM","Congress","Bengaluru Police","Basavaraj Bommai","40% commission Karnataka"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1033396/bengaluru-two-congress-workers-arrested-after-partys-paycm-40-posters-surface-in-city"}
