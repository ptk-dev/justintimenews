An absolutely clutch throw with his final attempt from Neeraj Chopra with his final attempt but it was not meant to be. Jakub Vadlejch set down the marker early on and the others were only playing catchup since then.Anderson Peters came good as well with his final attempt of 86.62m to finish third, but it was the usual Chopra style of going big in the first few throws implemented by the Czech Republican to walk away with the bragging rights from Doha.The other Indian in fray Kishore Jena, meanwhile, had a forgettable outing to finish ninth with a best of 76.31m. Both Chopra and Jena are now expected to fly back home to compete in the 27th Federation Cup on May 15 in Bhubaneswar. Thanks for tuning into our coverage.

The reigning javelin throw Olympic and world champion is all set to open his 2024 season at the Doha Diamond League. This will be his first competitive appearance since his gold medal win at the 2022 Asian Games in Hangzhou last year.Chopra spoke at length about his wish to break the 90m barrier this year in the pre-event press conference. The conditions in Doha have usually been kinder to javelin throwers ‚Äì big throws are a norm. Last year during the Diamond League, though, it was a bit different with a headwind to tackle with for the athletes. Chopra did end up winning the event then but that 90m mark has continued to elude him. Will tonight finally be the night he puts an end to this question?Competing alongside Chopra will be compatriot Kishore Kumar Jena, who gave him a scare at the Asian Games. What will the comparatively inexperienced Jena have to offer after a long training camp in Australia?
