{"title":"IND vs SL: ‘Business as usual for Virat Kohli’, ‘Majestic Shubman Gill’ – Reactions to special tons","content":"India pulled off another day of batting dominance in the third One Day International against Sri Lanka at Thiruvananthapuram on Sunday. Fluent, untroubled centuries by Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli added to the tourists’ misery in this series as they pushed India to 390/5 in a bid to clean sweep the series 3-0.First, Gill brought up his second ODI century and his first at home in 89 delieries. After a solid 95-run opening stand with Rohit Sharma, Gill combined with Virat Kohli to stitch a brilliant 131-run partnership. After Gill was dismissed for a well-made 116, Kohli took charge and how.He brought up his second century in this series, his 46th in this format and 74th overall. Kohli then changed gears to take his batting a level higher in the last ten overs to finish with 166.Both the centurions have had a series to remember with the bat as they top the run-scoring charts. Having scored 207 runs in the three innings at an average of 69, Gill has had yet another promising series since being given the opener’s role in the format. Kohli, meanwhile, is top of the table with 283 runs,  scoring two centuries and looking in sublime form.Here’s a look at their wagon wheels:BCCI.tvBCCI.tvHere’s a look at the reactions from the match:Lovely line from Harsha on Virat Kohli’s 46 ODI century: “The king is back to doing what he does best, scoring hundreds”.— Ian Raphael Bishop (@irbishi) January 15, 2023\n\nThe centuries are starting to roll off the conveyor belt again for #ViratKohli𓃵.— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) January 15, 2023\n\nI'm absolutely in love with these dragging on the back foot against anything shorter from SL spinners. From both Virat and Gill. Especially Virat bcs maybe we don't get to see him play this much recently.— Kaushik (@CricKaushik_) January 15, 2023\n\nFrom 2020-22 when the world was struggling with Covid, it's almost like Kohli's run-scoring was under lockdown as well. Nothing was normal. The world didn't feel like it. As the world gets back, so does Kohli. There are hints or normalcy again and this is the biggest proof.— Sarah Waris (@swaris16) January 15, 2023\n\nShubman Gill continues to build and learn. Generation next!👍🏼👍🏼.— Ian Raphael Bishop (@irbishi) January 15, 2023\n\nWe might be entering that phase in cricket history where a post-break Virat Kohli and Meg Lanning will redefine their own limits and the craft of batting itself, scaling heights previously unimagined. https://t.co/oB5saIvzgc— Annesha Ghosh (@ghosh_annesha) January 15, 2023\n\nGill’s rise to century making form has been the big gain for India this season. He’s looked classy from his u-19 days but often failed to live up to potential, convert good starts into big scores.

A man of his words. All of 71st, 72nd, 73rd and 74th followed this statement.
