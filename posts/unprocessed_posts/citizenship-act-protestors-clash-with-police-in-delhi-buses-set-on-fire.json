Anybody who goes out will go at their own risk.”A statement issued by the Jamia Teachers’ Association condemned the violence in south Delhi. “JTA appeals to students, if any, to keep away from such direction-less protest led by local political leaders,” the statement said. “Jamia practices and preaches peace. JTA condemn all sort of violence near Jamia or anywhere in India.”Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, in a tweet, appealed to the protestors to abjure violence. “No one shud [should] indulge in violence,” he tweeted. “Any kind of violence is unacceptable.

The cut-off date is December 31, 2014. The amendments were approved by both Houses of Parliament this week and were signed into law by President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday night.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2019-12-15T17:56:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/132885-selynsohvv-1576428232.jpg","tags":["Citizenship (Amendment) Bill","Jamia Millia Islamia","Delhi Police","Assam"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/946906/citizenship-act-protestors-clash-with-police-in-delhi-buses-set-on-fire"}
