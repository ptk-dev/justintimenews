He simply had to nod home from close range after being unchallenged by the Odisha defence.It was a similar defensive howler from Mohun Bagan at the other end, when Odisha FC took a corner in the 11th minute and left Carlos Delgado unmarked in the box. The Odisha defender made no mistake in volleying home from inside the six-yard box to level the scores.By the 39th minute, Odisha took the lead through Roy Krishna. Odisha goalkeeper Amrinder Singh played a long ball forward to Krishna who did not get a clean header to bring the ball under control.
