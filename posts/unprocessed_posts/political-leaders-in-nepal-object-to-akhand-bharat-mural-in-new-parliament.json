There is no point in visiting India if you can’t do that.” Former Nepal Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai said in a statement that the mural “may stoke unnecessary and harmful diplomatic row” between the countries. “It has the potential of further aggravating the trust deficit already vitiating the bilateral relations between most of the immediate neighbours of India,” Bhattarai added.But at a press conference on Friday, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “The mural in question depicts the spread of the Ashokan empire and the idea of responsible and people-oriented governance that he adopted and propagated. That is what the mural and the plaque in front of the mural says.”He refused to comment about the objections raised by political leaders in Nepal.India-Nepal tiesIn 2020, the relationship between India and Nepal had turned sour after Kathmandu claimed Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh areas in Uttarakhand to be its sovereign territory in a new political map. Nepal first revived its claim over the areas in November 2019 after India published a new political map. This was intensified on May 8 when India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the Dharchula-Lipulekh link road.In June 2019, India had asked Nepal to refrain from using an updated map to assert its territorial claims. It had criticised the move as an “artificial enlargement” and not based on historical facts and evidence.Nepal maintains that India has claimed these places by building the Darchula-Lipulekh link road despite repeated objections. India, on the other hand, has said that the road is within its territory.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-06-02T13:13:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190837-fmpugnarwn-1685690286.jpg","tags":["Nepal","India","Akhand Bharat"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1050230/political-leaders-in-nepal-object-to-akhand-bharat-mural-in-new-parliament"}
