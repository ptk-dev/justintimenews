After a record medal tally in the Olympics campaign earlier this month, India can expect another successful campaign at the Paralympics.Rio 2016, where 19 athletes represented India in five sports, was the country’s best-ever performance at a Summer Paralympics with a total of four medals – two gold, a silver and bronze – all in athletics. India will be looking to build on that with three of the four Rio medallists – Devendra Jhajharia, Varun Singh Bhati, Mariyappan Thangavelu – set for a reappearance.Tokyo will see a number of strong contenders in athletics and incidentally, javelin throw will be the event to watch out for at Paralympics too. Two-time gold medallist Jhajharia will be joined by Sundar Singh Gurjar (F46) as well as Sandeep Chaudhary and Sumit Antil (F64). Further, para-badminton is set to make its debut at Tokyo 2020 which boosts India’s medal chances with some top players in action. The Indian shooting contingent will also be a sizeable one with 10 athletes qualifying as compared to just one at Rio.

He had won a gold at the 2004 Athens Paralympic Games, setting a new world record of 62.15 metres.
