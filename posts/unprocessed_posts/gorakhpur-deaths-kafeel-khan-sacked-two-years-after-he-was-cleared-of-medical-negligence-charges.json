In September 2019, the Uttar Pradesh government cleared Khan of all charges and praised him for doing everything he could to help save lives. In the same year, the government suspended Khan again for allegedly treating patients forcibly at a hospital in Bahraich district.Khan on Thursday said that the government had acted against him even after he got a ‚Äúclean chit from a court‚Äù. He added that he was yet to receive his letter of termination from the Uttar Pradesh government. ‚ÄúAs soon as I get it, I will approach the High Court,‚Äù Khan said.63 kids died 'cos the govt didn't pay the O2 suppliers8 Doctors,employees got suspended -7 reinstatedinspite of getting clean chit on charges of medical negligence & corruption -I got terminated Parents-Still awaiting Justice justice ?

Khan claimed that of the eight people suspended in the children‚Äôs death case, everybody was reinstated to their jobs except him.Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi tweeted in support of the doctor, saying that his dismissal was driven by malice.‚ÄúMotivated  by a hate agenda, the government is doing all this to harass him,‚Äù she  said in a tweet in Hindi. ‚ÄúBut the government should keep in mind that  it is not above the Constitution.
