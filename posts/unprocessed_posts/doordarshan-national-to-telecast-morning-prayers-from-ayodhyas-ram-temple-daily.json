The incident had triggered communal riots across the country.मंगल भवन अमंगल हारी।द्रवहु सुदसरथ अजिर बिहारी।।अब हर दिन होंगे प्रभु श्री रामलला के दिव्य दर्शन! देखिए अयोध्या में श्री रामलला मंदिर से नित्य आरती का #Live प्रसारण, प्रतिदिन प्रातः 6:30 बजे सिर्फ #DDNational पर।#Ayodhya | #RamMandir | #ShriRamJanmbhoomi pic.twitter.com/IPf5ljaNXW— Doordarshan National दूरदर्शन नेशनल (@DDNational) March 11, 2024\n\n\nAlso read:In Ayodhya, firm linked to BJP leaders sold ecologically sensitive land to Adani – for a big profit1951 to 2019: How the Indian judiciary turned the Babri Masjid into the Ram Mandir","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-12T12:15:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/197952-bsiiotgwfc-1706455848.jpg","tags":["Ram temple","Narendra Modi","Ayodhya"]}
