Activist Saket Gokhale made the accusations in a series of tweets on Thursday that an advertising and social media company, owned by a BJP leader, was hired by Singh for election-related online work during the Assembly polls in the state last year.The Election Commission of India had asked Singh to submit a report in the matter.In a statement, the chief electoral officer said it was “misleading and incorrect” to suggest that he had engaged any agency on political considerations. “As per the standard practice, electoral awareness campaign is launched through an agency engaged by the Directorate General of Information and Public Relations of the Maharashtra government,” he added. “They [DG-IPR], in turn follow rules in force and a laid-down procedure for selecting an appropriate agency for public awareness and it is not [done] by the CEO office.”Singh said an interim reply of facts has been sent to the Election Commission of India in the case.Allegations made by GokhaleGokhale alleged that the firm belonged to Devang Dave, who is the BJP youth wing’s national convener of IT and social media. “It is beyond shocking that the Election Commission  chose a BJP IT cell guy and his agency to handle their social media for Maharashtra elections,” he tweeted. “The ECI [Election Commission of India] is supposed to be monitoring social media of parties during election.   Here, they literally worked with the ruling party.”The activist added that the address on the social media advertisements put out by the Maharashtra Election Commission belonged to Signpost India, a government-empanelled agency under Devendra Fadnavis’ government.Shocking details:Election Commission of India literally hired the BJP IT Cell for handling their social media in Maharashtra in the run-up to the 2019 State Assembly Elections.Thread 👇— Saket Gokhale (@SaketGokhale) July 23, 2020\n\nElection Commission of India Spokesperson Sheyphali Sharan said the poll body had taken note of Gokhale’s accusations and immediately asked for a detailed report from Maharashtra’s chief election officer.Regarding tweet of Mr Gokhale @SaketGokhale, Commission has sought detailed factual report in this matter from CEO Maharashtra with respect to alleged  locale of the incidence immediately.— Sheyphali Sharan (@SpokespersonECI) July 23, 2020\n\nCongress Spokesperson Sachin Sawant asked why the Election Commission did not verify the firm’s credentials before hiring it. “The poll body should work independently,” he said in a video posted on Twitter. “A firm belonging to BJP’s national office bearer was hired.
