He added the protestors were told not to discuss the meeting with Shah.“The protest movement hasn’t died down, it will continue,” Punia said. “We have been strategising on how to take it forward. The athletes aren’t satisfied with the government’s response, neither is the government agreeing to our demands.”He said that the wrestlers will not withdraw their protest based on assurances from the government. “We had gone back in January based on the government’s assurances, but were later declared liars,” the wrestler said.Last week, Thakur had accused the protesting wrestlers of “changing goalposts” and cautioned them to not take any step that could hurt the sport or other athletes, according to NDTV.“The athletes themselves had said that the platform is not for doing politics,” Thakur said, referring to visits by Opposition leaders to Jantar Mantar, where the wrestlers had been protesting earlier. “But later political parties came and went and shared this platform.”As wrestlers continue to demand Singh’s arrest, the BJP MP has remained unfazed and maintained that the allegations against him are false.However, details of the first information reports against the politician have shown that he demanded sexual favours in exchange for professional help from at least two female wrestlers and harassed over half a dozen players.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-06-07T10:18:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/191002-dsdefhfaxg-1686147908.jpg","tags":["Wrestlers","Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh","Sakshi Malik","Anurag Thakur","Wrestlers protest"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1050471/centre-invites-protesting-wrestlers-for-talks"}
