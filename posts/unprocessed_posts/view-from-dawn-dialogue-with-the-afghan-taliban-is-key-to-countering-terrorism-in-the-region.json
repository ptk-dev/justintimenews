{"title":"View from Dawn: Dialogue with the Afghan Taliban is key to countering terrorism in the region","content":"The Afghan Taliban may be unpleasant interlocutors, considering their  violent past and unimpressive attitude towards inclusivity and  democratic governance.Yet, one thing that many in the international community – particularly Afghanistan’s neighbours  – realise is that there are few  options but to engage with the group as it is, after all, the de facto  government in Kabul.Pakistan and China very much adhere to this thinking, as was evidenced by the recently concluded Fifth Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue in Islamabad, in which the top diplomats of Pakistan, China and Afghanistan participated.As expected, counterterrorism and economics topped the agenda, with  Pakistan and China gently reminding the Afghan side that more work had  to be done to ensure Afghanistan did not become a haven for terrorist  groups. Moreover, the proposal to extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan would also be significant for regional geo-economics, should it come to fruition.The dialogue also brought to the fore China’s growing desire to be  seen as a regional and global peacemaker, as Beijing seeks to deploy its  brand of diplomacy in trouble spots across the world.All three foreign ministers pledged to enhance counterterrorism  cooperation. For Pakistan, the presence of militant groups such as the  banned Tehreek-e-Taliban-e-Pakistan in Afghanistan is a major concern, one that has been communicated to Kabul on multiple occasions.China is also wary of militants using Afghanistan as a safe haven.  Just last month, its foreign ministry, pinpointing its concerns about  the Uighur militant group, observed that “ETIM [East Turkestan Islamic Movement] forces in Afghanistan  pose a severe threat to the security of China” – in fact, to the entire  region.Pakistan, China and other regional states must continue to pressure  the Taliban to ensure terrorist groups find no refuge on Afghan soil and the Taliban must be told again and again that expanded trade links  and their engagement with the international community will suffer unless  these groups are reined in.It is of note that the Afghan delegation was reminded by the Chinese  Foreign Minister Qin Gang of the need to “embrace inclusive governance  and moderate policies”, while Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said that his  message to the Afghan side was “help us help you”.After decades of instability and war, the people of Afghanistan need  an atmosphere free of militancy, where they can rebuild their country  and bring prosperity to millions, who currently depend on the kindness  of the international community to keep starvation at bay.The more pragmatic actors within the Afghan Taliban must prevail on  their hard-line leadership and convince them that the country can only  advance when all Afghans, including the female population, have a say in  governance, and when fundamental rights are protected, while the  international community must assure Afghans that it will help them get  through these difficult times.This article first appeared on Dawn.com.","author":"Dawn.com","time":"2023-05-15T21:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/189975-jyedflnrxn-1683629349.jpg","tags":["Taliban","Afghanistan Taliban","Pakistan","China"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1048821/view-from-dawn-dialogue-with-the-afghan-taliban-is-key-to-countering-terrorism-in-the-region"}
