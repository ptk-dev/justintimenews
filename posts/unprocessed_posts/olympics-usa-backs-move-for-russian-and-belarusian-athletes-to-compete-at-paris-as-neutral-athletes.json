{"title":"Olympics: USA backs move for Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete at Paris as neutral athletes","content":"The United States backs moves to allow athletes from Russia and  Belarus to take part at the 2024 Olympics as neutral athletes provided  they are prevented from displaying their national flags or emblems, the  White House said Thursday.“The United States has supported suspending Russia and Belarus’ sport  national governing bodies from international sports federations,” Press  Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.However, if athletes are invited to an international event, such as  the Olympics, “it should be absolutely clear that they are not  representing the Russian or Belarussian states,” she said.“The use of official state Russian, Belarussian flags, emblems and anthems should be prohibited as well.”The US position adds to a growing debate over the status of athletes from Russia and Belarus at the 2024 Paris Games.International Olympic Committee says sanctions against Russia and Belarus athletes ‘non negotiable’  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky staunchly opposes any  participation by Russian and Belarussian athletes, and has called for  Russia to be banned over its invasion of Ukraine.Russia is pushing for all restrictions to be lifted, arguing that the Olympics should not be politicized.The International Olympic Committee has said it is examining a  “pathway” for Russians to take part in the summer Games, probably as  neutral athletes.‘Criminal aggression’Writing on Twitter  shortly after the White House remarks on Thursday, Zelensky described  the IOC’s stance as a “legitimization of the criminal aggression against  Ukraine.”“We won’t allow sport to be used against humanity & for war propaganda!” Zelensky tweeted.The IOC’s willingness to allow Russian and Belarussian athletes in Paris has divided the sporting and diplomatic world.On Wednesday, two UN rights experts applauded the IOC’s moves to  allow athletes from the two countries to compete, arguing that no  athlete should be “discriminated against on the basis of their  nationality.”The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee has also  backed the IOC’s moves to create a pathway for Russian and Belarussian  athletes.In a conference call in December, USOPC chairwoman Susanne Lyons  warned that the “fabric” of the Olympic movement was at risk if athletes  were not given the chance to compete as neutrals.Barring Russian and Belarussian athletes from Paris risked a return to the Olympic boycotts of the 1970s and 1980s.“There are conflicts around the world every day, countries at war  every day, and if people decide they want to boycott things,  tit-for-tat, - ‘You didn’t come to our games, so we won’t come to your  games’ - very quickly the fabric of the Olympic and paralympic movement  falls apart,” Lyons said.US Olympic officials are adamant however that athletes would only be able to participate in “strictly neutral” uniforms.Similar words of support have come from the Olympic Council of Asia and the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo.But Britain, Poland and Baltic nations have all condemned the IOC’s position.Writing on Twitter after a meeting with his counterparts from the  Baltics and Poland in Riga earlier this week, Latvia’s foreign minister  Edgars Rinkevics said allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes at the  Olympics was “immoral and wrong.”British Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan said the IOC’s plans were  “a world away from the reality of war being felt by the Ukrainian  people.”“We will strongly condemn any action taken that allows President  Putin to legitimize his illegal war in Ukraine – a position the IOC  previously shared,” Donelan said.“We, and many other countries, have been unequivocal on this  throughout, and we will now work urgently across like-minded countries  to ensure that solidarity continues on this issue.”","author":"AFP","time":"2023-02-03T10:30:00+05:30","image":"https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/article/68393-lcmbanjrgm-1505371121.jpg","tags":["Volodymyr Zelensky","Paris 2024 Olympics","International Olympic Committee","Summer Olympic Games","Olympics","Russia","Belarus","War in Ukraine"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1043157/olympics-usa-backs-move-for-russian-and-belarusian-athletes-to-compete-at-paris-as-neutral-athletes"}
