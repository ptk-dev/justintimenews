The Election Commission pointed out that the officer’s statements were “totally uncalled for” and had “consequences for the holding of free and fair elections”. The commission sought a compliance report by 6 pm on Thursday.After Deo’s comments to the media, the Aam Aadmi Party had questioned the police investigation. The party’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh accused the officer of acting at the behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party, and said he should pin the lotus – the BJP’s symbol – on his shirt. The saffron party, meanwhile, claimed that the AAP had been exposed.Assembly elections in the national capital will be held on February 8, and the results will be declared on February 11.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2020-02-05T22:49:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/135919-nchzkvowar-1580922320.jpg","tags":["Election Commission","Shaheen Bagh","Rajesh Deo","Kapil Gujjar","Delhi Assembly elections"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/952274/ec-pulls-up-delhi-police-officer-who-linked-shaheen-bagh-gunman-to-aap-removes-him-from-poll-duty"}
