But there was a second assailant, who was in the crowd and he started firing at Abhishek Kumar.”Mishra said that one of the assailants was also shot at and is currently getting treated. Both the assailants are from Muzaffarpur, he said.“More information would emerge,” he said. “It is too early to come to a conclusion about the motive. More persons could be involved in the case.”Four bullet shells have been recovered from the court premises. The senior superintendent of police said that security at the premises is a matter of concern.He said that although two constables accompanying Kumar acted swiftly in this case, there is a “need to discuss court security”.
