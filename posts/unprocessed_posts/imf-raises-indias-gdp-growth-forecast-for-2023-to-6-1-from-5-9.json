This meant that countries could transition from emergency mode to managing the virus alongside other infectious diseases, the global health body had said.The International Monetary Fund, however, said on Tuesday that there are growing signs of global economic activity losing momentum. It said that excess savings from pandemic-related transfers are “all but depleted” in the United States, while in China, economic recovery following the re-opening of its economy is showing signs of losing steam.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-07-26T15:29:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/131892-ojbojqymjt-1644567225.jpg","tags":["IMF","growth","World Economic Outlook","International Monetary Fund"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1053309/imf-raises-indias-gdp-growth-forecast-for-2023-to-6-1-from-5-9"}
