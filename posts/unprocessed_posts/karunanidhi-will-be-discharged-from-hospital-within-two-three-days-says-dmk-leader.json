{"title":"Karunanidhi will be discharged from hospital within two-three days, says DMK leader","content":"Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief M Karunanidhi will be discharged from the hospital within “two-three days,” a senior party leader said on Saturday. “Karunanidhi’s health condition has improved a lot as compared to last week,” DMK’s Principal Secretary Duraimurugan told reporters. “He is able to listen to what we are saying. He has overcome the critical period and his health parameters are improving. He will return to home within two or three days.”Karunanidhi was admitted to Chennai’s Kauvery Hospital on July 28 after his blood pressure dropped. On July 31, the hospital said the ailing DMK chief will require an “extended period of hospitalisation”.The hospital said the former Tamil Nadu chief minister will remain in hospital due to “age related overall decline in his general health, altered liver functions and haematological parameters”. However, it added that Karunanidhi continued to “maintain his vital signs, with active medical support”.Several politicians have visited the veteran leader in the last one week. On Saturday, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and Union minister Suresh Prabhu enquired about the DMK chief’s health. “Visited @kalaignar89 at the Kauvery hospital, Chennai today and met with @mkstalin to discuss the DMK Chief’s health. Praying that he (Karunanidhi) recovers soon and gains his health back,” Naidu said on Twitter.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2018-08-05T09:31:38.302567+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/889278-25910654051_4b768204a6_o.jpg","tags":["M Karunanidhi","DMK"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/889278/karunanidhi-will-be-discharged-from-hospital-within-two-three-days-says-dmk-leader"}
