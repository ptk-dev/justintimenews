The audience, whom Modi described as being responsible for ‚Äúnew cinema for a new India‚Äù, replied by clapping and shouting, ‚ÄúHigh sir!‚ÄùAditya Dhar‚Äôs film  is based on the September 29, 2016, Indian Army operation on terrorist training camps in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. Uri: The Surgical Strike stars Vicky Kaushal as Major Vihaan Singh Shergill, who leads the operation. Paresh Rawal and Rajit Kapur plays characters modelled, respectively, on Ajit Doval and Narendra Modi. The line ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the josh?‚Äù is used by Vihaan to rally his soldiers.When PM @narendramodi asked this eminent gathering of Indian Film Industry- ‚ÄúHow is the Josh‚Äù. See how they replied by saying - ‚ÄúHigh Sir‚Äù. pic.twitter.com/gbPFVCngu6‚Äî RSPrasad Office (@OfficeOfRSP) January 19, 2019\n\nIn his speech at the inauguration, Modi said cinema is a ‚Äúsilent power‚Äù as it could bring about development and social change. ‚ÄúFilm and society are a reflection of each other,‚Äù Modi was quoted as saying by ANI. ‚ÄúWe have watched movies on India‚Äôs poverty and helplessness, but now we have films where if there is a problem, there is a solution too.‚ÄùNarendra Modi and Aamir Khan. Courtesy Twitter.Aamir Khan told Republic TV that Modi‚Äôs speech ‚Äúmade a lot of sense‚Äù to him. Khan added, ‚ÄúWell it was really wonderful to hear the honourable Prime Minister speak in such a positive way about the film industry.‚ÄùModi‚Äôs selfie-taking with Bollywood began a few weeks ago. On January 10, a 14-member delegation comprising directors and actors met Modi in Delhi. Thank u Hon‚Äôble PM @narendramodi. All of us who had the incredible opportunity to interact with u today represent the world‚Äôs largest film industry & together we would love to inspire & ignite positive changes towards a transformative India. pic.twitter.com/7h99wifTph‚Äî Karan Johar (@karanjohar) January 10, 2019\n\nFilmmaker Karan Johar, leading the delegation, wrote on Instagram that the interaction was about how the Hindi film community could contribute to ‚Äúnation building‚Äù.        View this post on Instagram           Thank you for meeting us today sir! @narendramodi ! An incredible exchange of thoughts and ideas with the forces of the film fraternity and the honourable Prime Minister! A post shared by  Karan Johar (@karanjohar) on Jan 10, 2019 at 8:09am PST\nAccompanying Johar were actors Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh, Varun Dhawan, Ayushmann Khurrana, Vicky Kaushal, Rajkummar Rao, Bhumi Pednekar and Sidharth Malhotra. Filmmakers Rohit Shetty and Ashwini Iyer and producer Ekta Kapoors and Mahaveer Jain were also a part of the selfie that had Modi at the centre.The meeting was organised by Johar and Mahaveer Jain, the producer of the National Film Award-winning  Dekh Indian Circus (2011). ‚ÄúThe next few months will bring a lot of good news for the industry,‚Äù Jain told The Times of India.The January event produced a lot more positive press than a previous meeting on December 18, 2018, to discuss, among other issues, General Sales Tax for the entertainment industries. The delegation that met Modi, which included Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, Karan Johar, Rakesh Roshan, Ronnie Screwvala and Siddharth Roy Kapur, comprised only men, and got rapped for its non-inclusiveness.Heartfelt thank you to the honorable Prime Minister @narendramodi ji for taking out time to hear us at length, discuss issues pertaining to our industry and assuring positive consideration of suggestions. pic.twitter.com/ShGfr0Jlvu‚Äî Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) December 18, 2018\n\nBefore these meetings, Modi was seen at the wedding reception of Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas in Delhi. Modi‚Äôs attendance drew some jibes on Twitter, because in 2017, Chopra was criticised by right-wing trolls for apparently disrespecting Modi by sitting cross-legged and wearing a skirt of seemingly inappropriate length.
