A bill to replace it was passed in the Lok Sabha last month, but remained pending in the Rajya Sabha. The government has promulgated the ordinance again after the Winter Session of Parliament ended on Wednesday.The Opposition had demanded that the legislation undergo scrutiny of a parliamentary committee.
