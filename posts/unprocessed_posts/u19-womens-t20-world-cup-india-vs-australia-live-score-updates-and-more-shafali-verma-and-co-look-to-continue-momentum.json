{"title":"U19 Women‚Äôs T20 World Cup, IND vs AUS as it happened:  India handed massive loss against Australia","content":"Scenarios: So South Africa beat Bangladesh and Australia beat India to leave Super Six Group A brilliantly poised. Australia‚Äôs big win has seen them overtake India on NRR but SA‚Äôs win comes as something of a relief for India. Australia / South Africa and India / Bangladesh have to face Sri Lanka and UAE respectively, and if they win those matches, all four of them will be on 6 points. India will have to win big and hope to keep their distance from the chasing pack.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n     Standings after Saturday Super Six Group A \n    \n       POS  TEAM  PLAYED  WON  LOST  N/R  TIED  NET RR  POINTS \n    \n     1  ¬†Australia U19  3  2  1  0  0  +2.348  4  2  ¬†India U19  3  2  1  0  0  +1.905  4  3  ¬†South Africa U19  3  2  1  0  0  +0.508  4  4  ¬†Bangladesh U19  3  2  1  0  0  +0.251  4  5  ¬†Sri Lanka U19  2  0  2  0  0  -2.950  0  6  ¬†UAE U19  2  0  2  0  0  -4.175  0 \n  \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Player of the match: Milly Illingworth (2/12 in 2 overs)\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    End of innings: Disappointment for India as they were thoroughly dominated in their first Super Six encounter after dominating through the group stage.

They won the opener against hosts South Africa by seven wickets and the second match against the United Arab Emirates by a colossal 122-run margin and topped it with a 85-run win over Scotland.But now the tests get harder. They take on Australia in what promises to be a crucial clash.India had defeated Australia in a warm-up game before the start of the World Cup and will be confident of continuing the good form. Sri Lanka are the other team in this Super Six stage that India will face. With six teams in a group, all playing two matches each, a defeat is likely to be costly.
