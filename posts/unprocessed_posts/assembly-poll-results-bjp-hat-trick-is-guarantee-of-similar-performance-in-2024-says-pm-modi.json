As per Election Commission figures at 8.36 pm, the BJP has comfortably crossed the majority mark in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. The Congress emerged victorious in Telangana.The prime minister said that the BJP’s victory is a win for the poor, the farmers and the marginalised. “This victory belongs to each and every person who wants to see ‘Viksit Bharat [developed India]’ in 2024,” he said.Modi claimed that the election results show that voters have “zero tolerance” for corruption, appeasement and nepotism.The prime minister said that the results constitute an important lesson for the Opposition’s INDIA alliance. “The lesson is that the country’s trust cannot be earned merely through some political families coming together on a stage,” he said. “A spirit of national service is needed to win the hearts of the people.”The INDIA bloc, or the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, comprises 28 parties that have come together with the stated intention of putting forward a united front to remove the BJP from power in 2024.

Otherwise, the people will remove you [from power].”The BJP is currently ahead in 164 out of 230 seats in Madhya Pradesh, 54 out of 90 seats in Chhattisgarh and 115 out of 199 seats in Rajasthan.
