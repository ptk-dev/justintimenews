{"title":"Lakhimpur Kheri: Video shows SUV running over protestors, Congress accuses Centre of complicity","content":"A video showing an SUV running over a group of protestors was shared by the Congress and several social media users on Tuesday. The party claimed that the video showed the incident that triggered violence in Uttar Pradesh‚Äôs Lakhimpur Kheri district on Sunday killing eight people, including four farmers.Farmer bodies had alleged that three farmers died after a vehicle that was part of a convoy of Union minister Ajay Mishra had run over protestors agitating against the contentious agriculture laws passed by the Centre last year.The police have not yet verified the authenticity of the video. Scroll.in could not verify the video independently. However, the locale that can be seen in the video looks similar to visuals that had emerged after Sunday‚Äôs incident.‚ÄúThe silence from the [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi govt [government] makes them complicit,‚Äù the Congress said in a tweet sharing the video.

Vadra was detained on Monday while on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri. She was taken to a guest house in Sitapur district..@narendramodi ‡§ú‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§∞‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§®‡•á ‡§¨‡§ó‡§º‡•à‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§ë‡§∞‡•ç‡§°‡§∞ ‡§î‡§∞ FIR ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§™‡§ø‡§õ‡§≤‡•á 28 ‡§ò‡§Ç‡§ü‡•á ‡§∏‡•á ‡§π‡§ø‡§∞‡§æ‡§∏‡§§ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§∞‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§¶‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ï‡•Å‡§ö‡§≤ ‡§¶‡•á‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§§‡§ï ‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞‡§´‡§º‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§π‡•Å‡§Ü‡•§ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§Ç? pic.twitter.com/0IF3iv0Ypi‚Äî Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) October 5, 2021\n\nLater, she posted a video message asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi why Ajay Mishra had not been dismissed from the Union Cabinet yet.
