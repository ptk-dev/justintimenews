The ministry was referring to recent racist posts about Indian labourers on social media. It said that the bulk of such online comments were “strikingly similar” to each other and “posted by fake accounts”. It said this is meant to strain relations between New Delhi and Taipei City.The remarks were sparked by a report on November 10 that Taiwan could hire as many as 1 lakh Indians to work at factories, farms and hospitals. The deal could be signed in December, according to Bloomberg.Taiwan-based Chinese language newspaper China Times reported on November 16 that a protest against the entry of Indian workers was being planned in the first week of December. Chinese language news media in Taiwan also reported about some individuals making derogatory remarks online, accusing Indians of being uneducated and raising concerns about the safety of women in Taiwan with the entry of Indian workers.The Taiwanese foreign ministry said that the country boasts of significant social diversity and has long embraced migrant workers without prejudice, including those from India.“We enjoy flourishing ties with the New Southbound Policy nation and aspire to further enhance our labour collaboration,” it said.The New Southbound Policy is a Taiwanese government initiative to boost cooperation with 18 countries, including India.The ministry added: “[China’s cognitive warfare is] a devious move to tarnish our national image and strain Taiwan-India relations, but the attempt to destroy goodwill in the Milk-Tea Alliance won’t prevail!”The Milk Tea Alliance refers to an informal solidarity movement uniting pro-democracy voices across Asia.The recent surge of racist remarks belittling Indian workers bears the hallmarks of #PRC cognitive warfare.
