{"title":"Why the BJP cannot be written off in Manipur despite the anger at its failure to end ethnic violence","content":"Before the ethnic conflict erupted in Manipur in May, Fanga Hauhnar’s days were spent studying for the Staff Selection Commission examination and helping his mother run an eatery in Churachandpur town.Now the 27-year-old from the Hmar tribe is a “village volunteer” deputed at the “frontline” – areas along the buffer zone between the Meitei-dominated Imphal valley and the tribal-majority Churachandpur and Kangpokpi districts.“The government cannot protect us fully,” Hauhnar said. “That’s why we have to take up arms.” Every month, for three days and three nights he takes up position at one of the many bunkers that dot the buffer zone – like other civilians from the community sucked into the conflict.Together, the Kuki, Zomi and Hmar tribes are one of the major groups in Manipur’s hill districts.Hauhnar squarely blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government at the state and the Centre for the disruption in his life. “It angers me that N Biren Singh is still the chief minister,” he said.The sentiment is heard frequently in the hilly town, which voted overwhelmingly for the BJP in the last Assembly elections, and now accuses the party of betraying the interests of the Kuki-Zomi-Hmar people. “No one trusts the government,” Hauhnar said.About 65 km away, in Imphal valley, Tolen Okram echoes Hauhnar – even if he is on the other side of a bitter ethnic divide that has split the state down the middle.The 66-year-old Meitei, a retired government engineer from Imphal valley, joined the BJP in 1982. “I am one of the party’s oldest members but I will not vote for them this time,” Okram said.Tolen Okram, a retired government engineer from Imphal valley and a BJP member, is reluctant to vote for the party this time.

The party is held responsible by both Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities for the failure to end the state’s deadly ethnic conflict, which has left at least 223 dead and around 70,000 displaced.The violence had begun in May last year soon after a massive rally held in the hills to protest a Manipur High Court decision that nudged the state government to grant Scheduled Tribe status to the majority Meitei community. Within hours, ethnic mobs were running amok across the state – the Meiteis picking on Kuki-Zos in the Imphal valley, and becoming their targets in the hills. Since then, at least 223 people have died in the violence and around 70,000 displaced.Despite this, observers and voters say the Hindutva party – and its ally National People’s Front – cannot be written off in the electoral contest.\n\t\t\n\tBJP candidate Th Basanta Singh (right) during an election meeting.

BJP leaders argue that the Centre and the state government have acted to “save the indigenous people of Manipur”.Several Meiteis blame the alleged influx of illegal migrants from the India-Myanmar border for the ethnic violence. Radical Meitei groups have even contested that Kuki-Zos are indigenous to the state.In the Inner Manipur constituency, which spans most of the Imphal valley districts barring parts of Kakching and Thoubal, the BJP has put up Thounaojam Basanta Singh, state Cabinet minister and former Indian Police Services officer.Taking him on is the Congress candidate Bimol Akoijam, an academic from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, who is known to be an articulate advocate of the Meitei cause and is no pushover in the contest.Akoijam has declared his support for a National Register of Citizens in Manipur – in line with the Meitei demand to identify undocumented migrants.“He has become the voice of the Meiteis in this conflict,” said L Somrendra Singh, a 54-year-old teacher in Moirang, a town near the picturesque Loktak Lake and only 4 km from another buffer zone. “He has countered the false narratives against the Meiteis since the beginning of the conflict,” Singh said.His neighbour, 46-year-old Shyam Kumar, a Meitei who runs an electric shop in Moirang, said Akoijam is popular among the youth and the educated. “Nobody likes the BJP anymore here,” he said.Despite this, he believes that BJP’s Basanta Singh has an edge.One of the reasons is the BJP’s strong organisational presence. “The Congress has failed to capitalise on the conflict,” a member of Akoijam's campaign team told Scroll. “It is lacking in grassroot volunteers. We have popular support. But that's not enough.”The editor of an Imphal-based English daily agreed with the assessment. “For the first time in the history of Manipur’s electoral politics, the Congress is riding on the shoulders of an individual [and not the party],” he said.In contrast, in the last decade, the BJP has become “a well-oiled machine”, he said.“The BJP is organised and knows how to campaign,” said another Imphal-based journalist. “Though there are no public meetings or campaigns, the BJP MLAs and ministers have activated booth-level workers.”Meira Paibis in Imphal’s Singjamei area.

The seat is spread across the tribal-majority hill districts of the state, home to Manipur’s two major tribal communities – Nagas and Kuki-Zos.A Kuki girl in Churachandpur town looks at a photograph of a relative who died in the ethnic conflict.

The party is believed to have the backing of the powerful militant group, the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah).The Congress has fielded former Ukhrul MLA Alfred K Arthur. The BJP has stayed away from the contest, though it is backing the NPF.  Both the BJP’s and Kuki-Zo groups’ decision not to field candidates is seen as an olive branch to the Nagas. The N Biren Singh-led state government cannot afford to antagonise Nagas as he has already opened a front against the Kukis, observers say. The Kuki-Zos too are trying to propitiate the Nagas by not contesting elections, several officials in the district administration, security establishment and community leaders told Scroll. “This election is a platform for advancing tribal solidarity in Manipur,” said a leader of Kuki Inpi, the apex community body of the Kukis. “That is why the Kukis do not have a candidate but will support a Naga.”There is an undercurrent of sympathy for the Congress candidate Alfred K Arthur, who is known for espousing tribal rights as a legislator. “He has been vocal about tribal rights and solidarity,” said the Kuki Inpi leader. “It is likely that the Kukis will support the Congress candidate though any official decision has not been made.”What complicates the choice is the ambivalence about sending a message to the Centre by voting against the BJP-supported NPF candidate – especially when a ceasefire agreement between Kuki-Zo militant groups and the Indian state is up for renewal.The government led by N Biren Singh walked out of the SoO – the Suspension of Operations agreement – in March last year. In recent months, legislators from the Meitei community have passed an Assembly resolution demanding that the agreement be scrapped, a nod to the Meitei belief that Kuki militant groups were responsible for the violence.The Centre is yet to renew the agreement though it was meant to be extended in March this year. “Neither was it abrogated,” a Kuki National Organisation leader told Scroll. “It's a tripartite arrangement. So the state is creating problems wherever possible.”In the past, the SoO groups have backed the BJP. In the last Lok Sabha election, the Kuki National Organisation or KNO, an umbrella body of Kuki militant groups that signed a Suspension of Operations agreement, issued a diktat asking people to vote for the BJP.The KNO leader laid out their dilemma. “The BJP government is in dialogue with us,” he told Scroll. “That is why Kukis voted for the BJP and elected seven BJP MLAs in 2022. As SoO groups are still in dialogue with the Centre, many may think about voting for its ally, the NPF.”","author":"Rokibuz Zaman","time":"2024-04-16T06:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/200055-ttbykmjdcz-1713173588.jpg","tags":["Manipur","BJP","Manipur unrest","Kuki","Meitei","ethnic conflict","Lok Sabha election 2024","Lok Sabha 2024"]}
