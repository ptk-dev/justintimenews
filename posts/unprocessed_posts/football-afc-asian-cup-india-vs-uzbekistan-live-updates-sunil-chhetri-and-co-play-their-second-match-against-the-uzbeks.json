{"title":"Football, AFC Asian Cup, India vs Uzbekistan as it happened: Uzbeks earn comfortable win","content":"That’s it for our coverage of India’s group stage match against Uzbekistan from the AFC Asian Cup.Uzbekistan were the better team, both in the world rank and in what they showed on the pitch. India are now at the bottom of the group with two losses from two games, meaning the team does not have a chance to make it through as a top-two team.The Blue Tigers take on Syria in their last group stage match. A big, big win there could possibly take them through to the knockout stage as one of the best third-placed teams. But they will have to show a greater degree of defensive discipline and attacking prowess than what they showed tonight.That match takes place on January 23 and 5 pm IST.

A cross comes in from the right flank and Sherzod Nasrullaev is left unchallenged by his marker Manvir Singh. Nasrullaev makes a mess of his connection as the ball comes off his thigh, but it sends Gurpreet Singh Sandhu scrambling. The ball crashes off the post and sits up kindly for Nasrullaev who is the only player to react.

A few quick passes and Nikhil Poojary steps into the box from the left flank. His attempted pass though is weak, but Uzbekistan's defender Eshmurodov Umarbek's clearance is mistimed and his slashes it towards his own goal. Utkir Yusupov, the Uzbekistan goalkeeper, was alert and made a smart diving save.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    35 min – India 0-2 Uzbekistan: India has started to see a little more of the ball and have spent some more time in the Uzbekistan half.

A defensive error from Rahul Bheke near the half-line and Abbosbek Fayzullaev charged down the left flank. He nutmegged Sandesh Jhingan and played a low cross looking for his teammate. Akash Mishra got their first, but his attempted clearance crashed off the post (almost an own goal).

In their first move towards the Indian goal, the Uzbeks have found the back of the net. Abbosbek Fayzullaev, the 20-year-old Uzbek, started the move with a pass down the left flank. A cross came in and was looped forward to the youngster who was left completely unmarked by a ball-watching Indian defence. Gurpreet Singh Sandhu came off his line and tried to make himself big, but Fayzullaev calmly slotted his header into goal.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    This is a must win game for both teams.
