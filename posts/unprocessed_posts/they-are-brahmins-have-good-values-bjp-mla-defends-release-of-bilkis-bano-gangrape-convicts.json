She was 19 and pregnant at the time. Fourteen members of her family, including her three-year-old daughter, were murdered by the rioters near Ahmedabad. One of the men snatched the girl from her mother’s arms and smashed her head on a rock.Gujarat Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Raj Kumar said that the government considered their remission application as the convicts had served 14 years in jail as well as due to other factors such as “age, nature of the crime, [and] behaviour in prison”.The decision to release them was based on the recommendation of a panel formed by the Gujarat government under the guidelines of the Supreme Court.On Monday, the convicts were greeted with sweets by their relatives after their release. A member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh felicitated them as well.In the interview to Mojo Story, Raulji also said that in cases of communal violence, innocent persons are often targeted. He added that family members of the convicts were “honest”.Raulji’s statement has drew widespread criticism from several Twitter users.Historian Audrey Truschke said the comments showed that caste was “in action in modern times”.“In premodern Sanskrit texts, different punishments are prescribed for people depending on caste, with Brahmins getting off easiest,” she wrote on Twitter. “Why? Because they’re Brahmins.”Wow, caste in action in modern times.In premodern Sanskrit texts, different punishments are prescribed for people depending on caste, with Brahmins getting off easiest. Why? Because they're Brahmins. https://t.co/uTyHOlmVLc— Dr. Audrey Truschke (@AudreyTruschke) August 18, 2022\n\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation leader Kavita Krishnan said the Narendra Modi-led central government was attempting to fool women in the name Uniform Civil Code and women empowerment initiative Beti Bachao.Mr @narendramodi your @BJP4India MLA released Bilkis’ gang rapists who smashed her baby girl’s skull in, coz they’re  Brahmin, & thus cultured.

Even if the Brahmin commits a very serious offence, he should not be tortured or hung. He should be sent away with his belongings.
