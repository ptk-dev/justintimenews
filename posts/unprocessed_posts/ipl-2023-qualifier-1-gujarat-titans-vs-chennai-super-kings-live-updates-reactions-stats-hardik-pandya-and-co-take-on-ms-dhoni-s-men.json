Around a year back, the team finished the league in 9th place. Dhoni was ageing. The team didn’t look strong on paper. Not sure they even had that great an auction to be honest, but here we are... Dhoni has done what Dhoni does best. Made CSK greater than the sum of their parts.That will be all for the blog.

Once a player comes into the team, the first thing that not just MS (Dhoni), but everybody in the support staff does is they have they have a conversation with the player, define the role expressively to the player. And they make them understand what their role is going to be and they keep an open line of communication with them at all times.Experienced players especially want a line of communication that’s open to the heads of the team. And they want clarity of their roles. The minute that’s given, most good players are happy, and they know how to work from there to give their best because every player wants to go out there and put his best foot forward and put up great performances for their team.And when this communication is done, and clarity of role is defined to the player, it makes it a lot more simpler. There is a sense of security within a group. You know, I think it’s human nature, that when there is security, your focus is always is on performance. But when there is no security, when you’re deeply insecure within a group, then your focus is always on survival. And when you work from the mode of survival, you cannot focus on performances, you will only focus on surviving within that group. When you work from a place of being very secure, you work on thriving, you work on performing and doing the best that you’re capable of, I think, which is what CSK bring out of players.I think that’s one of the biggest secrets here and that’s why all the experienced players go there and start performing well.— via interaction facilitated by JioCinema\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    #IPL2023 Going in with the same playing XI, Chennai Super Kings.MS Dhoni and Co are nothing if not consistent. 👌🏽One of their many formulas for success.
