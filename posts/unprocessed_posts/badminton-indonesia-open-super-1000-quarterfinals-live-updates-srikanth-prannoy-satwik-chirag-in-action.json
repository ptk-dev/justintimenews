{"title":"Indonesia Open Super 1000, QFs blog: Satwik-Chirag stun world No 1; Prannoy sets up Axelsen clash","content":"08.45 pm: That will be all for today’s blog. We will leave you with a quick preview of tomorrow’s action and the schedule.Men’s doubles, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty vs Kang Min Hyuk and Seo Seung Jae: World No 6 vs World No 12, this one. The Indians will be meeting Kang/Seo for the fourth time and have won two of the past three meetings. While the Indians came through with a dominant win against an Indonesian Pair, the Koreans did the same too, outplaying Marthin and Carnando. Kang/Seo won the Malaysia Masters last month and are in good form. Men’s. singles semifinal, HS Prannoy vs Viktor Axelsen: Well, Axelsen has shown already this week that there are no signs of rustiness after his injury break. He has breezed through so far. But worth noting that Prannoy too has come through three tough tests in straight games. Axelsen leads the H2H 5-2 but Prannoy has won the last two times they have met. The last meeting, worth noting, was a dead rubber of sorts in the group stages at last year’s World Tour Finals. But Prannoy knows what it takes. And he will have to bring his absolute best to deal with the best.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    via Badminton4U \n\n    #IndonesiaOpen2023 #IndonesiaOpenSuper1000 🏸What a finish to the day's action at Istora Senayan!

We didn’t play well at the Sudirman Cup, the Thailand Open and the Singapore Open. That was the lowest low we could’ve gone.“Both of us were quite depressed with the way we played. We spoke to each other and we knew we had to go higher, and the way we got back this week, beating the Chinese yesterday and today the world No.1 on their home court, it couldn’t have gone any better. But we’re still hungry and we want to go all the way.“After Swiss Open and after the Asian Championships, we were on a 10-match winning streak – I wouldn’t say we were not hungry at all, but there was slight dip. A few matches here and there and suddenly the confidence went down.“The Singapore Open was one of those matches when we felt really bad, after going out in the first round, and we knew we had to come back, and from then on we pushed as hard as possible in the one week we got, in training. The results are showing. The main aspect is the hunger to win, and I think we had that this week.”— via BWF\n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    HS Prannoy’s reaction after the win against Kodai Naraoka:“[Sudirman Cup Finals] was the first tournament we got in after a break, and there was rustiness.“And the first tie didn’t go our way, that kind of changed the whole tournament for us. Everybody woke up after that loss. Everybody felt really bad. As individuals also, all of us were down for four days.“It took a while for us to regroup and get back, and then the Malaysia Open was a good chance, and a lot of fire was there to prove ourselves again to the supporters. I’m sure they were also disappointed with what happened at the Sudirman Cup because there were a lot of expectations post-Thomas Cup. But I think that fire actually gave a lot of good results in Malaysia and as a team also we started playing very well.

No, just kidding. I note down things when when we play against players. We do video analysis for all matches, and if there is some small key notes that I think that I need to note down, I’m doing it in that book. I like to actually keep it in the book, it’s also easier than sitting with a laptop. I have notes on my laptop also but it’s easy just to recall, than to check online when we played this pair the last time if I can’t remember. And then just look up under the tournament then in my book, see if there is something that I missed in the new video analysis.And also sometimes in the matches, I note down a few things if there’s something that I didn’t realise doing video analysis or they have changed something since then, or whatever it can be, then sometimes I’m taking small notes just to to have some key points on what to what to tell the players.Interview: Mathias Boe, the meticulous Dane guiding Satwiksairaj Rankireddy-Chirag Shetty to the top\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    MD quarterfinals, Alfian-Ardianto 13-21 Satwik-Chirag: And the lead for the Indians.
