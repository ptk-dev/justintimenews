{"title":"Ayodhya case: 10 articles on the title dispute ahead of Supreme Court verdict ","content":"The Supreme Court will on Saturday pronounce its judgement in the Ayodhya land dispute case. The five-judge Constitution Bench had heard arguments daily for 40 days from August 6. This was the second-longest hearing in the top court’s history after the landmark 68 days of proceedings in the Keshavananda Bharati case.On the last day of hearing on October 16, the Ayodhya mediation committee filed a settlement document in the top court. According to an unidentified official, the parties in the case had reached a settlement though its details are confidential.The mediators – former Supreme Court judge FMI Kalifulla, religious leader Sri Sri Ravishankar, and senior advocate Sriram Panchu – had approached the court on September 16 for permission to resume talks to amicably resolve the title dispute. The court allowed them to hold dialogue to resolve the dispute even as it continued hearing the 14 appeals against the 2010 Allahabad High Court judgement dividing the 2.77-acre land equally among three parties the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara and Ram Lalla.The talks had abruptly stopped on July 29 because of resistance from certain parties, forcing the court to start daily hearings.In anticipation of the judgement, restrictive orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which bans the assembly of more than four people, were imposed in Ayodhya. They will be in place till December 10. The Uttar Pradesh government has cancelled the holidays of all field officers in the state’s 75 districts till November 30.Here is a round-up of stories on Scroll.in on the dispute:Ayodhya dispute has several parties battling each other in court: Both Ram Lalla and Nirmohi Akhara want control of land and dispute each other’s claims.
