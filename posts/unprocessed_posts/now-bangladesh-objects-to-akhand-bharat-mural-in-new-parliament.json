Nepal considers Lumbini as one of the major cultural centres on its map. The foreign ministry of Pakistan has also objected to the mural.On Monday, Bangladeshi minister Alam took cognisance of Bagchi’s clarification, saying that the mural depicts the journey of people. “There may be cultural similarities, but it has nothing to do with politics,” he had said.In Bangladesh, resentment has been simmering over the mural since last week as several political parties – besides the ruling Awami League – had criticised their country being included in the mural, according to the newspaper Prothom Alo. Jatiyo Samajtantrik Dal, an ally of the ruling Awami League, said that there was no such thing as “Akhand Bharat” in the political map of India after 1947. “The display of a map of undivided India in India’s parliament building is unwarranted,” the party’s president Hasanul Huq Inu told Prothom Alo.Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the secretary-general of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, said that displaying Bangladesh as part of the undivided map of any other nation was a threat to his country’s independence and sovereignty.The Rastra Sangskar Andolan said in a statement said: “It is objectionable for Bangladesh to be included as part of Akhand Bharat in the imagined map of the Indian rulers.”","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-06-07T13:27:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190837-fmpugnarwn-1685690286.jpg","tags":["Bangladesh","India","Akhand Bharat"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1050489/now-bangladesh-objects-to-akhand-bharat-mural-in-new-parliament"}
