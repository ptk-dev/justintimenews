Officials from the US Department of Homeland Security apprehended 10 students in Texas, three in Kansas and 17 in California, according to reports received by overseas educational consultants in Hyderabad. The students are expected to reach India in two days, reported Deccan Chronicle.The Ministry of External Affairs said the US government had clarified that these cases were not related to any blacklisted universities. The US claimed the students were being sent back for providing information inconsistent with their visa status. The US had earlier this month deported around 30 Indian students admitted to Silicon Valley University and Northwestern Polytechnic University. This had forced national carrier Air India to stop 19 students from boarding a flight to San Francisco from Hyderabad.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2015-12-30T20:06:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/801180-article-kzogsiypfw-1450327914.jpeg","tags":["Air India","students deported from US"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/801180/30-students-deported-for-working-illegally-in-us"}
