The court said that on December 6, 1992, the mosque was brought down in breach of the assurance given to it that the structure would not be affected. It added that the Muslims had not abandoned the mosque when it was destroyed.Invoking Article 142 of the Indian Constitution, the top court had said it must ensure that “a wrong committed must be remedied”.

The court had also restored criminal conspiracy charges filed against Advani and Joshi along with Vinay Katiyar, Sadhvi Ritambhara and Vishnu Hari Dalmia. It restored charges against several other Hindutva leaders who had earlier been acquitted in the case. Three other high-profile accused – Giriraj Kishore, Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal and Vishnu Hari Dalmia – died during trial and the proceedings against them were abated.Arguments of the defence and prosecution concluded on September 1, after which the special judge began writing the verdict. The CBI had produced almost 351 witnesses and 600 documents before the court. Last month, the Supreme Court had set September 30 as the deadline to complete the trial and deliver a verdict.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2020-09-30T10:01:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/148347-lnnwmixikf-1601448160.jpg","tags":["babri masjid demolition","babri masjid","ayodhya case","lk advani","babri masjid demolition case verdict"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/974489/babri-masjid-demolition-verdict-expected-soon-security-beefed-up-in-lucknow-ayodhya"}
