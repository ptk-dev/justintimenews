{"title":"India at Tokyo Paralympics: Medallists, close calls & more â€“ complete results from an epic campaign","content":"A 54-member contingent from India was expected to have a successful Paralympic Games and they delivered in sensational style. In Indiaâ€™s entire history of Paralympic Games, the total medal tally stood at 12 before the campaign at Tokyo 2020 began. There was a feeling Indian athletes would get close to that tally at the very least, but they ended up winning more medals in one edition than in the countryâ€™s entire history. From a total of 19 athletes at Rio Paralympics, India returned with a total of 19 medals at Toyko Paralympics. And given the number of fourth-place finishes (six in all) and one medal that was taken away, the number could well have been even higher but for some fine margins.Still, it was a campaign that tore up the history books and set new milestones for India in para sports.

Athletics had accounted for 10 of the 12 medals, with swimming and powerlifting accounting for the other two. At Tokyo, India won historic first-time medals in shooting, table tennis and archery, while adding four more from badmintonâ€™s long-awaited debut at the Games. At the conclusion of Tokyo 2020, India enjoyed their most successful Olympic Games as well as Paralympic Games in history.

One of the things you always hear associated with the Summer Games is how participation in itself is no mean feat, but it is especially more so in a year like 2021. The pandemic-delayed Games made things challenging in some way or the other for every athlete to took part across Tokyo 2020.On that note, we take a look at the overall results from every event featuring an Indian athlete at the Tokyo Paralympics:ArcheryRecovering from a less than ideal qualifying round, Harvinder Singh went on to create history for Indian archery with a bronze medal in recurve individual (open). And what a thrilling ride he took to get there, winning three shootoffs in one day. There was disappointment elsewhere though as Rakesh Kumarâ€™s impressive compound campaign came to a close in a thrilling quarter-final.

Sumit Antilâ€™s record-breaking performance was the undoubted headliner, with Devendra Jhajharia equalling the feat of Joginder Singh Bediâ€™s, by winning his third medal at the Games. The high jump and javelin throw gave India their medals, while Yogesh Kathuniya stood out with his discus throw silver.Track and Jumps\n    \n       Event  Name  Results \n    \n     Men's High Jump - T47  Nishad KumarÂ   Best mark: 2.06 (=Asian Record / PB)Final rank: 2nd (SILVER)    Ram Pal  Best mark:Â 1.94 (=Personal Best)Final rank: 5th  Men's High Jump - T63  Varun Singh BhatiÂ   Best mark:Â 1.77 (Season Best)Final rank: 7th    Sharad KumarÂ   Best mark: 1.83 (Season Best)Final rank: 3rd (BRONZE)    Mariyappan ThangaveluÂ   Best mark: 1.86 (Season Best)Final rank: 2nd (SILVER)  Men's High Jump - T64  Praveen KumarÂ   Best mark:Â 2.07 (Asian Record / PB)Final rank: 2nd (SILVER)  Women's 100m - T13  Simran Sharma  Heat timing:Â 12.69s (5th)Overall rank: 11th \n  ThrowsJavelin throw at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo continued to remain special for India as Sumit joined Neeraj Chorpa is winning the gold medal. While Jhajhariaâ€™s silver was another chapter in a glorious journey, Sundar Singh Gurjar completed a redemption story after having missed his event at Rio 2016 controversially and heartbreakingly. It was a moment to savour for him and Indian athletics with two athletes on the podium. The fourth-place finish for Sandeep Chaudhary was one of the heartbreaks in Tokyo for India as it was an event where Sumit-Sandeep were even expected to finish 1-2.

Suhas Yathiraj nearly pulled off one of the upsets of the Games but eventually finished second after losing against top seed Lucas Mazur in the final. The fourth medal came from Manoj Sarkar, who had the chance to set up an all-Indian final but eventually finished with bronze in SL3 alongside Bhagat. In Palak Kohli, India have a teenage shuttler capable of big results at the world stage and she showed her fighting spirit and shot-making abilities in spades, reaching the quarter-final in singles and coming close to a medal with Bhagat in mixed doubles. The Indian pair pulled off a massive upset by defeating the world No 3 pair in their group and lost a hard-fought battle in the bronze playoff. Parul Parmar and Tarun Dhillon also returned without podium finishes. Parmar, the 48-year-old veteran, however, seemed to enjoy her time on the court, battling through tough matches in her non-preferred category. Perhaps, the disappointment was only from Tarun, who started with two wins but couldnâ€™t get past the finish line in his last three matches and paid the price. All in all, a superb campaign.Paralympics: Indiaâ€™s badminton success, expected and hard-earned, must act as a catalyst for change\n    \n       Event  Name  Age \n    \n     Men's Singles SL3  Pramod BhagatÂ   Record: Played 4, won 4Rank: 1st (GOLD)  Men's Singles SL3  Manoj SarkarÂ   Record: Played 4, won 2Rank: 3rd (BRONZE)  Men's Singles SL4  Suhas YathirajÂ   Record: Played 5, won 3Rank: 2nd (SILVER)  Men's Singles SL4  Tarun Dhillon  Record: Played 5, won 2Rank: 4th  Men's Singles SH6  Krishna Nagar  Record: Played 4, won 4Rank: 1st (GOLD)  Women's Singles SL4  Parul ParmarÂ   Record: Played 2, lost 2Rank: 5th  Women's Singles SU5  Palak KohliÂ   Record: Played 3, won 1Rank: 5th  Women's Doubles SL3-SU5  Palak Kohli-Parul Parmar  Record: Played 2, lost 2Rank: 5th  Mixed Doubles SL3-SU5  Pramod Bhagat-Palak Kohli  Record: Played 4, won 1Rank: 4th \n  #Tokyo2020 #Paralympics ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥‡The ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ National Anthem for the fifth time at Tokyo Paralympics! ðŸŽ¥ DD Sportspic.twitter.com/2I91cqFEHEâ€” The Field (@thefield_in) September 5, 2021\n\nCanoe SprintIn a discipline making its debut at the Games, Indiaâ€™s first Paralympian to be a part of canoe sprint â€“ Prachi Yadav â€“ finished a creditable eighth overall, after reaching the final.

With only one finalist at the Olympic Games being a disappointing return, the Paralympic Games saw multiple final appearances, two teenagers winning gold medals (with one of them adding another), and a veteran winning multiple medals as well. There were couple of heartbreaks thrown in there for good measure too. PistolSinghraj Adhana and Manish Narwal provided one of the best moments of the Games for India with their 1-2 finish in the 50m pistol event. The 19-year-old Narwal topped the qualification in the 10m event but the veteran clinched the medal there. Rubina Francis and Rahul Jakhar were among the finalists, with the latter coming close to a medal finish. \n    \n       Event  Name  Results \n    \n     P1 - Men's 10m Air Pistol SH1  Manish NarwalÂ   Qualification rank: 1stFinal rank: 7th    Deepender SinghÂ   Qualification rank: 10thFinal rank: N/A    Singhraj  Qualification rank: 6thFinal rank: 3rd (BRONZE)  P2 - Women's 10m Air Pistol SH1  Rubina FrancisÂ   Qualification rank: 7thFinal rank: 7th  P3 - Mixed 25m Pistol SH1  Akash  Qualification rank: 20thFinal rank: N/A    Rahul Jakhar  Qualification rank: 2ndFinal rank: 5th  P4 - Mixed 50m Pistol SH1  Akash  Qualification rank: 27thFinal rank: N/A    Manish NarwalÂ   Qualification rank: 7thFinal rank: 1st (GOLD, PR)    Singhraj  Qualification rank: 4thFinal rank: 2nd (SILVER) \n  RifleThe star of the show was none other than 19-year-old Avani Lekhara, who became the first Indian woman to win a Paralympics gold medal and also the first Indian woman to multiple Paralympics medals.Curious teen with a connection to the rifle: Story of Avani Lekharaâ€™s historic Paralympics campaignElsewhere, Swaroop Unhalkar was minutes away from ensuring a podium finish but paid the price for a bad series by finishing fourth.
