The Army said that during the operation, twelve members of Meitei militant group Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup were apprehended “along with arms, ammunition and war-like stores”.Among those who were apprehended was Moirangthem Tamba alias Uttam, who was accused of having masterminded an ambush on an Army unit in 2015 that had left 20 soldiers dead.Unedited UAV Footage@adgpi @easterncomd #Manipur pic.twitter.com/mfVWK0CHKt— SpearCorps.IndianArmy (@Spearcorps) June 24, 2023\n\nHowever, the Army said that a mob of 1,200 to 1,500 people led by women surrounded the area and prevented security forces from going ahead with the operation.“Keeping in view the sensitivity of use of kinetic force against large irate mob led by women and likely casualties due to such action, considered decision was taken to hand over all 12 cadres to local leader,” the Spear Corps said.Security forces subsequently lifted the cordon and left the area with weapons and ammunition recovered from the militants.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-06-25T09:58:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190938-zkjvcqjwkh-1686029195.jpg","tags":["Army","Imphal East","Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup","KYKL","Manipur"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1051515/manipur-army-releases-12-militants-after-being-surrounded-by-1200-strong-mob"}
