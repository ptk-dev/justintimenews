Kiran Navgire scored a sensational 34-ball 69 on her debut innings in this event. The fastest half century too in this tournament, came off just 25 balls. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Now imagine if the Women’s IPL had happened a couple of years... maybe a Kiran Navgire could have been unearthed earlier?
