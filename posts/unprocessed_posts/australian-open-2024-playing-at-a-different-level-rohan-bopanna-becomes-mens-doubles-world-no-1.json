{"title":"Australian Open 2024: Playing at a different level, Rohan Bopanna becomes men’s doubles world No 1","content":"In the history of the chest-bump celebrations in tennis, Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden pulled off the mellowest version. It was uncoordinated and seemed like an impromptu decision. But it never really would have mattered.With that one final smash of a tennis ball from the Bopanna racquet at the Margaret Court Arena, the pair were through to the semi-final of the Australian Open. But in the greater scheme of things, Bopanna, at the age of 43, had become the world No 1 in men’s doubles – the oldest man to ever get to that spot for the first time.“It has been incredible,” he said after the match.“Being in this sport for 20 years, playing these tournaments week in week out… Today, reaching this No 1 ranking is amazing. It’s a proud feeling.”Also read: Rohan Bopanna interview: ‘I’m still able to compete at the highest level, that is a proud feeling’This was not the only first he achieved at the Australian Open this term.

But he embraced Iyengar Yoga and found a new way to strengthen his damaged knees in his tall 6-foot-4 frame.And then his fortunes started to shift.The man from Coorg, armed with a powerful serve and big groundstrokes, reached the semi-final of the French Open for the first time in his career in 2022.By the start of the 2023 season, he would pair up with Ebden, a former singles world No 39, who has won the men’s doubles Wimbledon title in 2022 and has an Australian Open mixed doubles title in 2013 to his name.And together they have forged a formidable partnership that has taken both of them to their respective career highs – Ebden is projected to get to the world No 2 spot once the rankings are updated after the Australian Open.“I think the biggest thing was that whatever the situation, both of us had already been in that kind of situations,” Bopanna had said.“You just take the feedback from one another and then find the right balance. No situation was overwhelming for us. There were no self-doubts. Trusting your partner was extremely important.”What else is important is that Bopanna has found the formula to keep himself healthy in a sport that has increasingly become physically demanding.Replug: Rohan Bopanna, wiser on court and healthy off it, finds no reason to stop after two decades on tourHe asserted that he tends to skip practice on many days in favour of recovery sessions.
