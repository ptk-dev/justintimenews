{"title":"Protest watch: Actor Nandita Das says people don’t want another partition, lauds the ‘Shaheen Baghs’","content":"Actor-director Nandita Das on Thursday endorsed the series of protests against the amended Citizenship Act, joining the bandwagon of celebrities opposing the controversial law. “All these wonderful students and women, the many Shaheen Baghs springing up around the country, they are giving us a lot of courage to speak up,” Das said on the sidelines of the 13th edition of Jaipur Literary Fest. She called the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens “very divisive”. Das added that the large-scale protests being held across the country offer a sense of solidarity. “It is important to come out sometimes on the streets not just to expand the protests but for your own conscience. Sometimes, we need these reminders and reaffirmations that we are not alone.”Das said more and more people are speaking up because they do not want another partition to happen. “If Manto were alive today, he would have said have you learned nothing from the past,” she added.\n\n\n    \n    Play\n\nThe administration in Jharkhand imposed a curfew in Lohardaga town after violence and arson erupted at a rally in support of the amended Citizenship Act, organised by the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, The Times of India reported.

He is a clown. Any number of his contemporaries from NSD [National School of Drama] and FTII [Film and Television Institute of India] can testify to his sycophantic nature. It is in his blood. He can’t help it.”The Citizenship Amendment Act, approved by Parliament on December 11 last year and notified on January 10, provides citizenship to refugees from six minority religious communities from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, provided they have lived in India for six years and entered the country by December 31, 2014.The Act, which has been widely criticised for excluding Muslims, triggered nationwide protests in December. At least 26 people died during demonstrations that month – all in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam. In the North East, people have protested against the law as they believe it threatens the region’s indigenous cultures.\n\n\n    \n    Play\n\nMeanwhile, curfew was imposed in Jharkhand’s Lohardaga city on Friday, a day after violence erupted during a rally in support of the new citizenship law, reported ANI.
