{"title":"IPL 2023: For Rinku Singh, a season to remember  at Kolkata Knight Riders","content":"One of the highlights of the IPL 2023 season has been watching Rinku Singh bat out of his skin for Kolkata Knight Riders. Not once, not twice, but multiple times – enough to become the season leading run-scorer for his team. He always had it in him, as was displayed in the game against Lucknow Super Giants last year where he scored a 15-ball 40. He repeated those heroics against the same opposition with an unbeaten 67 off 33 on Sunday to take the game excruciatingly close. As if the five sixes in five balls in the last over against Gujarat Titans earlier this season wasn’t a crazy enough feat.Also read:IPL 2023: From Rinku to Pooran – a few days of audacious knocks that will go down as IPL classicsOn Saturday at Eden Gardens, he made Kolkata dream again even when they needed 40 off the last two overs. Although LSG prevailed by 1 run and KKR bowed out of the tournament, it doesn’t dull Rinku’s shine this season.This year, he took his batting several notches higher, scoring 474 runs at an average of 59.25. The record gets better when KKR were chasing, as he scored 305 runs in only seven innings of run-chase, with a 152.50 average, a strike rate of 174.28, and four half-centuries.

But I’m not thinking on the lines of selection for the Indian team. I will stick to my routine, continue my practice. The name and fame will be there but I’ll just stick to my work.“My family members are very happy. A lot of things have worked well. When I played that innings last year, people started noticing me. After I hit those five sixes I started getting a lot of respect from the people and now a lot of people recognise me. So it feels good,” he said.What appears as a cherry on the top is getting the acknowledgement from his peers and legendary cricketers. In an interview with Jio Cinema earlier this season, Virat Kohli referenced Rinku’s exploits to explain how much the game is growing.He said, “What the youngsters are doing today is amazing to see. Just recently, Rinku Singh hits five Sixes in last five balls which is amazing and something like that never happened. So that transition is happening is great. It is great to see such youngsters coming up.”Most 6s in the 20th over in an IPL season: 9 - Rinku, 2023 (27 balls)8 - Bravo, 2012 (33)8 - Rohit, 2013 (17)8 - Dhoni, 2014 (31)8 - H Pandya, 2019 (23)8 - Dhoni, 2019 (29)7* - Dhoni, 2023 (28)#Rinku #IPL2023 pic.twitter.com/qQcc1oq6CV— Bharath Seervi (@SeerviBharath) May 21, 2023\n\nFormer India head coach Ravi Shastri, on after the performance of the UP batter, said on Star Sports, “Rinku Singh is the hero of Kolkata Knight Riders. His temperament is very strong and gets very comfortable in tough situations. He’s a battle-hardened player. Rinku likes close matches and this ability to do well in crunch situations is what separates this player from others.”Here are some stats from Rinku’s season:Most runs at No.5 or lower in an IPL season:474 - RINKU SINGH in 2023472 - Dinesh Karthik in 2018437 - David Miller in 2022419 - Kieron Pollard in 2013406 - Andre Russell in 2019#IPL2023 #KKRvLSG— Kausthub Gudipati (@kaustats) May 20, 2023\n\nRinku Singh while chasing in IPL 2023:- 305 Runs- 152.50 Avg- 174.29 SRAmong batters who have faced 100+ balls while chasing this season, nobody else has an average of 100 or more.

On multiple occasions, Nitish Rana has lavished praise and expressed his belief in Rinku. For instance, after the knock against LSG, he said: “I think it feels like all 14 matches I’ve spoken about Rinku. I am personally very happy for him (Rinku) the way the season has gone for him. He is quite close to me and I know how much hard work he has done. I don’t really have words to describe him because the entire country knows what he has done. If he can bat in situations like these, he can do anything.”After his blitz against Gujarat Titans, Rana had added: “Reporters had asked me the other day, why Rinku does not play a bigger role. If this is his secondary role, then imagine what he can do in a primary role. I do not have words to describe Rinku’s innings.”Andre Russell said in the post-match presentation after the duo took the side to a win against Punjab Kings: “When you have Rinku at the other end, I’m not worried of taking a single. He said, ‘Russ, what if the ball beats you, should we go for it?’ I said, ‘Yes, sure!’ Because I have confidence in him and the angle coming into him as well is a little easier because the ball was tailing away from me. (Arshdeep) was nailing his yorkers wide. So I’m happy.”Rana had said: “When he was batting, the entire crowd was chanting ‘Rinku, Rinku’. He has earned that this year. I get goosebumps. I have played here for six years now. Earlier the crowd used to chant ‘Russell, Russell’ and I used to feel good because Russell had done so many things. When the crowd is chanting for Rinku, it makes me very happy.”Now, having won the confidence of many more and grown in experience and ability to pull off miracles, Rinku is bound to play that primary role for his team in the coming years. With stadiums now cheering his name out loud, it is only befitting. Here’s a look at some reactions to season Rinku had:Ravi Bishnoi on Rinku Singh after #KKRvLSG:\"The way Rinku was batting, we were worried on every ball that he can take the game away from us\"\"I have never seen anyone batting like this for some time.

His Ranji numbers are of a DADA player. Not one to just think about IPL. An all-format player proving his worth that too batting down the order! #IPL2023— Arani Basu (@AraniBasuTOI) May 21, 2023\n\nKKR have finished where they were supposed to, but Rinku Singh has exceeded my expectations this season!Nearly 500 runs in IPL 2023 at approx. 60 Avg and 150 SR! And all of it has come while batting in a demanding middle-order role! What a player! Surely, he is going to serve…— Prasenjit Dey (@CricPrasen) May 20, 2023\n\nClearly the story of #IPL2023 is Rinku Singh. Unreal season for someone who batted at No. 5 or lower through the tournament. Was consistently a threat for the opposition. What a guy! Hoping for brighter things ahead for the KKR batter. #KKRvLSG— S.

LSG win by just one run to secure a playoff birth. It was Rinku Singh who almost took KKR for a consolation win, but it was just not meant for them tonight. #KKRvsLSG #IPL2023 pic.twitter.com/VSGys7IFQ0— Ridhima Pathak (@PathakRidhima) May 20, 2023\n\nWhatever the result, Rinku is a  bonafide superstar 🙌🏼🌟 Thank you for the entertainment this #TataIPL pic.twitter.com/2HCC2lDPG3— Gaurav Kapur (@gauravkapur) May 20, 2023","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-05-21T13:19:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190385-ouzvypbymi-1684654249.jpg","tags":["Rinku Singh","Kolkata Knight Riders","KKR","IPL 2023","IPL","Lucknow Super Giants","Virat Kohli","Nitish Rana"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1049487/ipl-2023-rinku-singh-had-a-season-to-remember-for-kolkata-knight-riders"}
