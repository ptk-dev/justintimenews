{"title":"INDIA bloc will ‘throw out’ 50% cap on caste-based reservations, says Rahul Gandhi","content":"The INDIA bloc will “throw out” the 50% cap on caste-based reservations if it is voted to power in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday.The Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, or INDIA, is a coalition of 28 Opposition parties that plans to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance in the general elections.“There will be no reduction in the reservation of Dalits and Adivasis,” Gandhi said during his ongoing Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Jharkhand’s Ranchi. “I am giving you a guarantee that the backward sections of society will get their rights. This is the biggest issue – social and economic injustice.”He also reiterated the promise of conducting a nationwide caste census.“This is the biggest question before India,” said the Congress MP. “Our first step would be to get a caste census in the country.”The announcements are in line with the “guarantees” the Congress announced in October after a meeting of the party’s working committee.On October 9, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge stated that “[a Congress government will remove the 50% limit on reservation for OBCs [Other Backward Classes], Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to ensure rights in accordance with share of population.”Sharing some excerpts from my opening remarks in the Congress Working Committee Meeting, held today in Delhi — • I extend a warm welcome to this Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting.

They are attacking democracy and the Constitution, and want to suppress the voice of the people. The INDIA coalition will not let the voice of democracy be suppressed.”The Wayanad MP’s statements came soon after the Champai Soren government in Jharkhand won the floor test by securing 47 votes in the 81-member Assembly.The floor test was necessitated after Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Champai Soren became the chief minister on February 2. Governor CP Radhakrishnan had given him 10 days to prove his government’s majority in the Assembly.This came after Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Hemant Soren resigned as the chief minister on January 31, shortly before getting arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case.Also read: Explainer: How Supreme Court put in place a 50% quota cap (and why it’s frequently breached)","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-02-06T09:14:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/198200-ylempvywbz-1707189199.jpg","tags":["INDIA","Rahul Gandhi","BJP","reservations"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1063257/india-bloc-will-throw-out-50-cap-on-caste-based-reservations-says-rahul-gandhi"}
