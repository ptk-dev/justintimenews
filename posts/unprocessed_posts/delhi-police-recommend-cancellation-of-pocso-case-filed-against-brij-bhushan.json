On the basis of his assurance, the wrestlers had suspended their protest for a week.The BJP MP has maintained that the allegations against him are false. However, details of the FIRs against the politician show that he allegedly demanded sexual favours in exchange for professional help from at least two female wrestlers as well as harassed over half a dozen players.On May 28, Punia, Malik and Phogat had tried to lead a march towards the new Parliament complex in New Delhi that was being inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the time. However, the wrestlers were manhandled by the Delhi Police and were detained at several police stations for about ten hours.They were booked by the Delhi Police for rioting and obstructing public servants from discharging their duty. On June 7, Thakur said the cases will be withdrawn.‘Law of the Land crushed’: CongressThe Congress on Thursday criticised the Centre after the Delhi Police sought to withdraw charges under the POCSO Act against Singh, saying that the “cry for justice” of India’s daughters has been “consigned to the dustbin and buried”.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the entire apparatus of the BJP government was pressed into service to save Bhushan.“The real slogan is ‘scare daughters, save Brij Bhushan’,” he said. “...Today, the Law of the Land has crumbled and been crushed under the bulldozer of BJP’s politics.”The Real Slogan is👇“ बेटी डराओ, बृजभूषण बचाओ”Today is a “black day” for Indian Sports!Today, Law of the land has crumbled & been crushed under the bulldozer of BJP’s politics.Today, “cry for justice” of India’s daughters has been consigned to dustbin & buried by Modi… pic.twitter.com/QliPj8IjsW— Randeep Singh Surjewala (@rssurjewala) June 15, 2023\n\nCongress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate alleged that out of the 1,000-page chargesheet against Singh, over 500 pages were dedicated to how a clean chit has been given to him and how the whole case under POCSO has been withdrawn.“The POCSO Act says that the moment the case is filed, the perpetrator of the crime has to be arrested so that he does not tamper with witnesses or intimidate victims,” she said, according to PTI. “Nothing of that sort happened with the BJP MP.”","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-06-15T13:13:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/191260-wzqepimehn-1686819510.jpg","tags":["Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh","Delhi Police","sexual harassment","Wrestling Federation of India"]}
