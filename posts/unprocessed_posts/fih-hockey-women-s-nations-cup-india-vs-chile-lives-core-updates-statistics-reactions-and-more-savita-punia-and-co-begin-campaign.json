Tonight we look forward to the Indian women‚Äôs team returning to international competitive action from a break, participating in the inaugural edition of FIH Hockey Women‚Äôs Nations Cup. From Tokyo to Birmingham, from a fourth place finish at the Olympic Games to a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games, the past few months have been one of evolution for the Indian women‚Äôs team. They now take on a new challenge in the Nations Cup, which is a tournament meant to help with promotion/relegation for the Pro League. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    pic.twitter.com/dr4Xjn7Flb‚Äî Hockey India (@TheHockeyIndia) December 11, 2022\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Screenshots via FanCode / FIH","author":"Vinayakk Mohanarangan","time":"2022-12-11T19:40:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/176640-qgdvahjegi-1656857655.jpg","tags":["FIH Hockey Women's Nations Cup","Vandana Katariya","Savita Punia"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1039515/fih-hockey-women-s-nations-cup-india-vs-chile-lives-core-updates-statistics-reactions-and-more-savita-punia-and-co-begin-campaign"}
