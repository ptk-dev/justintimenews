It stated that Sharma was in an inebriated state when he barged into their room and assaulted them just after they returned to their accomodation following a match.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-04-02T18:41:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/178564-fcuetkcfbs-1660652064.jpeg","tags":["Football","Indian Football","Indian Women's League","Khad FC","Deepak Sharma","All India Football Federation"]}
