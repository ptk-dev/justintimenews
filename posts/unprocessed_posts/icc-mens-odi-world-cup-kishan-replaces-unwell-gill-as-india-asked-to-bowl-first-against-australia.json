{"title":"ICC Men’s ODI World Cup: Jadeja, Rahul and Kohli star as India secure six-wicket win over Australia","content":"Virat Kohli and KL Rahul hit defiant knocks to lift India from a perilous three down for two runs to a six-wicket win over Australia in their opening ICC Men’s ODI World Cup match on Sunday.Chasing a tricky target of 200, India lost three batsmen, who all failed to score, inside two overs before Kohli (85) and Rahul (97 not out) put on 165.Victory was secured with 52 balls to spare.Spinner Ravindra Jadeja returned figures of 3-28 to help bowl out Australia for 199 in 49.3 overs in the 150th ODI meeting between the two cricket giants.Australia’s fast bowlers then came out all guns blazing to rattle the Indian top-order after left-arm quick Mitchell Starc sent back Ishan Kishan for a duck in the first over.Josh Hazlewood struck twice in the next to remove skipper Rohit Sharma lbw and then Shreyas Iyer caught at cover also for nought to silence the home crowd of 32,531.Hazlewood nearly made it four down when he got Kohli to top-edge a delivery only for Mitchell Marsh to drop a skier. Kohli was on 12 at the time.Kohli made the most of the reprieve as the star batsman reached his 67th ODI half-century and raised his bat to acknowledge the loud cheers.Rahul soon reached his fifty in the 28th over as India went to 106-3 and in control.Kohli finally fell to Hazlewood caught out at mid-wicket and walked off to standing ovation.Rahul hit the winning six with Hardik Pandya at the other end.“I had just taken a shower and was hoping to put my feet up for half an hour after the fielding innings, but I had to come in,” said Rahul of his unexpectedly early arrival at the crease.“Virat said that I should play like Test cricket for a bit.”Australia captain Pat Cummins admitted his team had been “50 runs short”.“Facing the spinners was tough and it was the kind of wicket you had to get yourself in.”Five-time champions Australia won the toss and elected to bat first but faltered.Jadeja stood out in his 10 overs of left-arm spin. Fellow spinner Kuldeep Yadav and fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah took two wickets each.Australia lost an early wicket before veteran batsmen David Warner (41) and Steve Smith (46) hit back in a partnership of 69.Kohli made an early impact with a diving slip catch to send back Marsh, for a six-ball duck, off Bumrah.The left-handed Warner reached 1,000 World Cup runs, passing Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar’s previous best landmark. Warner needed 19 innings to Tendulkar’s 20.Kuldeep, a left-arm wrist spinner, broke the stand to send back Warner, caught and bowled.Jadeja bowled Smith to deny the former captain his fifty and then struck twice in his next over including wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey for a duck to rattle the opposition batting.Australia collapsed from 110-2 to 140-7 before Cummins hit the first six of the match, but fell for 15.Number nine Mitchell Starc hit 28 to add some respect to the total.A match-winning partnership followed by a warm hug 🤗Well played, KL Rahul & Virat Kohli 👏#CWC23 | #INDvAUS | #TeamIndia | #MeninBlue pic.twitter.com/aVdbkVHekz— BCCI (@BCCI) October 8, 2023\n\nI was surprised to see Australia bat first after winning the toss. Commendable performance by the Indian bowlers to restrict them to 199. Australia started well but I felt they missed a left-arm spinner on this surface.

Rahul & Virat ensured that there were no hiccups on the way. What a game for India! 👏👏👏#ICCCricketWorldCup #INDvAUS— Sanjay Manjrekar (@sanjaymanjrekar) October 8, 2023\n\nA splendid victory for India in the World Cup opener! 🥳Bowlers on fire, and a Kohli-Rahul duo that showed pure class. 🏏Our batting start did give a mini heart attack but it's good that our middle order gets match time right from the start! ✌🏻Well played! 🇮🇳#INDvAUS pic.twitter.com/XaZ756FO00— DK (@DineshKarthik) October 8, 2023\n\nI remember KL Rahul getting a lot of criticism. I never understood it. In the middle order in ODIs, he is excellent.— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) October 8, 2023\n\nGreat innings under pressure to get the side back on track! Deserved to get to a 100 👊🏻 King Kohli at his best 👑 Good start to the World Cup campaign! @imVkohli— Yuvraj Singh (@YUVSTRONG12) October 8, 2023\n\nPressure doesn't get bigger than when you're 2/3 in a WC game vs a charged up Aus. Then to soak the pressure, wrestle the initiative back, and win the game takes something special. This was a partnership for the ages 🙌🏽 Well played 👏🏽 #INDvAUS #CWC2023 pic.twitter.com/QDJ5uuR1TL— Wasim Jaffer (@WasimJaffer14) October 8, 2023\n\nIndia 🇮🇳 started the World Cup campaign with a bang. Team is looking solid. Kohli never disappoints the team when he is really needed. Today was no different. And Kl Rahul is playing with great Klass. jaddu baapu tu to kamal che 👏 #IndVsAus— Irfan Pathan (@IrfanPathan) October 8, 2023\n\nThis is the first ever successful ODI chase after 3 of top-4 batters were out for ducks.#INDvAUS pic.twitter.com/7Di0AOQbMq— Kausthub Gudipati (@kaustats) October 8, 2023\n\nIn the ability to understand a situation and adjust your game to the requirements of that situation, Virat Kohli is unparalleled in modern ODI cricket— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) October 8, 2023\n\nIndia have started the tournament in style. KL Rahul and Virat Kohli were outstanding and despite 3 batsman failing winning so comfortably is ominous sign.

Superb start for the World Cup 👏👏 #ICCWorldCup2023 #INDvAUS pic.twitter.com/Mgbt7bk7v3— Vinay Kumar R (@Vinay_Kumar_R) October 8, 2023\n\nKohli's played well, but having KL Rahul at No.5 just makes it so hard to run through this Indian batting. Plenty of teams have a less secure batter at No.5, more of a dynamic hitter - Klaasen, Buttler, Maxwell - but India's more orthodox option gives them real solidity.— Ben Jones (@benjonescricket) October 8, 2023\n\n5 to win9 for the 100You need a 4 and then a 6And you hit the world's best fast bowler for a mind-boggling 6 over extra cover. Except you timed it too well, you only wanted a 4. And you go down on your haunches sheepishly.Can't think of a more KL Rahul moment than this.— Nitin Sundar🎙️✒️🎦 (@knittins) October 8, 2023\n\nCHENNAI SUPER KING 👑 #INDvAUS #CWC2023 #Jadeja pic.twitter.com/20wTcA35Ro— Wasim Jaffer (@WasimJaffer14) October 8, 2023\n\nWith text inputs from AFP","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-10-08T13:55:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/194823-ueinmujzeu-1696784345.jpg","tags":["India","Australia","ICC Men's ODI World Cup","Shubman Gill","ICC Men's ODI World Cup 2023","ICC Men's Cricket World Cup","World Cup","Cricket World Cup","England","Pakistan","South Africa","New Zealand","Sri Lanka","Netherlands","Bangladesh","Afghanistan","World Cup in India","Cricket scores","cricket updates","World Cup scores","World Cup updates","Rohit Sharma","Virat Kohli","Jos Buttler","Babar Azam","David Warner","Steve Smith","Kane Williamson","Shaheen Shah Afridi","Rashid Khan","Jasprit Bumrah","Ben Stokes","Kagiso Rabada"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1057262/icc-mens-odi-world-cup-kishan-replaces-unwell-gill-as-india-asked-to-bowl-first-against-australia"}
