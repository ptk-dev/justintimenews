{"title":"The Art of Resistance: A poet and parliamentarian yearns for justice and equality in India","content":"Writer, poet, intellectual and member of Parliament from Tamil Nadu, D Ravikumar brings to his works the sharp analysis of an Ambedkarite and the accumulated wisdom of fighting and writing for the marginalised over the decades.His poem, It is indeed my wish, emerges out of the turbulence of 2019, when the rights of Kashmiris were trampled upon by the Indian state, with an erosion of the institutions expected to guard these rights. The year ended with police violence on those protesting against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act – citizens seeking to protect India’s secular Constitution.Ravikumar’s poem is at once a record of 2019 and a hope for a better future. It is a yearning for justice and dignity, a call to his fellow countrymen to eschew violence and inequality.It is indeed my wish to sayThat another house will not be burnedThat another throat will not be slitAnother honour not defiledAnother passage not deniedAnother door will not be shutAnother opportunity will not be blockedIt is indeed my wish to sayThat everyone’s voice will be heardAll grievances are redressedThat every wound is healedEvery tear is wipedAnd everyone’s view respectedIt is indeed my wish to sayThat the innocent will be identifiedAnd the guilty punishedThat the vile ones will be removedAnd the virtuous recognisedIt is indeed my wish to saythe next year won’t be like this yearTranslated from Tamil by K Venkataramanan.Read all the articles in the Art of Resistance series here.","author":" D Ravikumar","time":"2020-01-01T21:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/133836-clzoecfgih-1577793755.jpg","tags":["Tamil Poetry","D Ravikumar","The Art of Resistance"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/948329/the-art-of-resistance-a-poet-and-parliamentarian-yearns-for-justice-and-equality-in-india"}
