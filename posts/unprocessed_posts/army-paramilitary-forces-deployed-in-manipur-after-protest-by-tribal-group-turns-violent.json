{"title":"Manipur issues shoot-at-sight order in ‘extreme cases’ after stir against ST status turns violent","content":"The Manipur government on Thursday issued shoot-at-sight orders throughout the state for “extreme cases” after incidents of violence were reported from several parts following a tribal agitation.The government authorised district magistrates and sub-divisional magistrates to issue such orders “in extreme cases whereby all forms of persuasion, warning, reasonable force, etc have been exhausted”.On Wednesday, thousands of tribals participated in a march called by the All Tribal Students Union of Manipur across all the ten hill districts of the state to oppose the demand of the majority Meitei community to be included in the Scheduled Tribe category.The march was organised after the Manipur High Court, in an order on April 19, asked the Bharatiya Janata Party government to consider petitions for including the Meitei community in the Scheduled Tribe list “expeditiously, preferably within a period of four weeks”.The police told PTI that during the march in the Torbung area of Churachandpur district, an armed mob allegedly attacked those belonging to the Meitei community. This led to retaliatory attacks and the situation turned volatile across the state.Several shops and houses were vandalised and burnt in arson that lasted for over three hours in Torbung, according to the police.In the Imphal valley, homes of Kuki tribals were ransacked in several areas, forcing them to flee, the police said. Over 500 residents of the Kuki-dominated Langol area in Imphal West are currently staying at the Central Reserve Police Force camp at Lamphelpat, according to PTI.Over 20 houses were also burnt in the Motbung area of Kangpokpi district. Violence was also reported in Moreh, near the Myanmar border.The Army and paramilitary forces were deployed in Manipur to quell violence.#IndianArmy & #AssamRifles undertook major rescue operations to evacuate more than 7500 personnel, of all communities, relentlessly throughout the night to restore law & order in #Manipur.@SpokespersonMoD @adgpi @official_dgar pic.twitter.com/wEKA2Mc841— PRO, Kohima & Imphal, Ministry of Defence (@prodefkohima) May 4, 2023\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the Army said that around 7,500 people were rescued by the forces from the Churachandpur, Kangpokpi and Imphal districts.“The columns of Army and Assam Rifles along with Manipur police have intervened promptly to control the situation,” it said. “Violence was controlled by morning hours.

The community claims that it faces difficulties due to large-scale illegal immigration by Myanmarese and Bangladeshi nationals. They are not allowed to settle in the state’s hilly areas as per existing laws.On the other hand, the tribal communities fear that Meiteis may take over their land resources if they are given Scheduled Tribe status.Also read:Why Manipur’s tribes are alarmed by court push for Scheduled Tribe status for the Meitei community","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-05-04T12:01:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/189813-cilcxolspm-1683211063.jpg","tags":["Manipur","Meiteis","Imphal"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1048516/army-paramilitary-forces-deployed-in-manipur-after-protest-by-tribal-group-turns-violent"}
