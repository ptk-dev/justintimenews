Pakistani terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for the attack.“Brothers and sisters, we also want to ask – what happened to the mangalsutras of the widows of those who were killed in the Pulwama attack?” Adityanath purportedly says in the video. “What happened to the [families and] widows of those young men?”On April 21, Modi at a rally in Rajasthan had claimed that the Congress’ manifesto talks about calculating “the amount of gold that mothers and sisters have, get information about it and then distribute that property” among Muslim “infiltrators” and “those who have more children”.The prime minister added: “This urban Naxal thinking will not spare even the mangalsutras of my mothers and sisters.” The term “urban Naxals” is used by BJP supporters to describe those who oppose the Modi government.On Thursday, Additional Superintendent of Police Raj Kumar Mishra said that Gupta had admitted to uploading the video on social media.He said that the accused was a local leader of small vendors in Noida. “He [Gupta] also owned a small kiosk and cart,” the police officer said.On Sunday, the Delhi Police had registered a first information report pertaining to a doctored video of Union home minister Amit Shah in which he can be purportedly heard saying that the Bharatiya Janata Party will end reservations for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in government jobs and education.What Shah had actually said – as seen in the original video that was recorded during an election rally in Telangana – was that the BJP would do away with reservations for Muslims in the southern state.Muslims have had access to 4% reservations in education and government jobs under the Other Backward Classes category in Telangana since 2007.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-05-02T15:49:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/185218-zhzdunmvrj-1672844144.jpg","tags":["Uttar Pradesh","Yogi Adityanath","Shyam Kishor Gupta","Raj Kumar Mishra","Special Task Force"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1067359/uttar-pradesh-police-arrest-man-for-sharing-doctored-video-of-chief-minister-adityanath"}
