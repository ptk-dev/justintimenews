Its head Swati Maliwal on Sunday wrote to the deputy commissioner of police, saying “this is a very serious matter” concerning the safety and security of women wrestlers.

The committee was given a one-month deadline. But the panel submitted its report in the first week of April and its findings have not been made public so far, according to PTI. Singh had appeared before the Indian Olympic Association and the government’s oversight committee in connection with the case.Earlier this month, Phogat had said that the athletes have lost faith in the committee and were considering legal action against Singh. “Why is there secrecy over the findings of the oversight committee and the details about how they went about the probe?” she had asked. “Women wrestlers have shown the courage to speak about what they faced but it seems like their words don’t matter.”Singh, who has completed 12 years as the Wrestling Federation of India president, has denied the allegations against him. But the athletes have insisted that they know at least 10-12 women who have been sexually harassed by him.Also read:With pending criminal cases, wrestling chief accused of sexual abuse is no stranger to controversyWith wrestlers’ protest against sexual harassment, is India finally facing its Larry Nassar moment?","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-04-23T19:11:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/189421-knqpnopxwf-1682254253.jpg","tags":["Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh","Vinesh Phogat","Indian wrestlers","BJP"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1047870/top-indian-wrestlers-resume-protest-against-wfi-chief-accused-of-sexual-harassment"}
