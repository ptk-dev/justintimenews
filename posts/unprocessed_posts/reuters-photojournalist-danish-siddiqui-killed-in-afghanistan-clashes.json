An Afghan forces commander said that they had been fighting to recapture the main market area of Spin Boldak district of Kandahar when Siddiqui and a senior military officer were killed in Taliban crossfire.Earlier on Friday, the journalist had been wounded in his arm by a shrapnel while reporting on the clashes, Reuters reported. He was treated and had been recovering when Taliban fighters retreated from the fighting in Spin Boldak. Siddiqui was speaking to local shopkeepers when the Taliban attacked again, the Afghan commander said.Reuters, however, could not verify the commander’s version of the incident independently.Siddiqui’s death led to an outpouring of grief from his colleagues and other quarters.“Danish was an outstanding journalist, a devoted husband and father, and a much-loved colleague,” Reuters President Michael Friedenberg and Editor-in-Chief Alessandra Galloni said in a statement. “Our thoughts are with his family at this terrible time.”Afghanistan’s Ambassador to India Farid Mamundzay also expressed grief. “Deeply disturbed by the sad news of the killing of a friend, Danish Siddiqui in Kandahar last night,” he tweeted. “The Indian journalist and winner of Pulitzer Prize was embedded with Afghan security forces. I met him two weeks ago before his departure to Kabul. Condolences to his family and Reuters.”Deeply disturbed by the sad news of the killing of a friend, Danish Seddiqi in Kandahar last night.

In a series of tweets on July 13, the Indian photojournalist had described his travel with Afghan Special Forces on its missions. He said that the objective of the mission was to extract a wounded police officer, who was trapped by the Taliban on the outskirts of Kandahar city. The area, he pointed out, is contested between the Afghanistan government and the Taliban.As the forces reached the extraction point, Siddiqui tweeted, the Taliban used rocket-propelled grenades against the convoy, resulting in the destruction of three Humvees. One of the rockets hit the vehicle he was travelling in, but Siddiqui had said that he was safe.“Gunners atop the Humvees swivelled wildly, aiming fire at suspected Taliban fighters who were hard to see,” he wrote.The Humvee in which I was travelling with other special forces was also targeted by at least 3 RPG rounds and other weapons. I was lucky to be safe and capture the visual of one of the rockets hitting the armour plate overhead. pic.twitter.com/wipJmmtupp— Danish Siddiqui (@dansiddiqui) July 13, 2021\n\nSiddiqui was a Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist and the chief of Reuters Pictures multimedia team in India.
