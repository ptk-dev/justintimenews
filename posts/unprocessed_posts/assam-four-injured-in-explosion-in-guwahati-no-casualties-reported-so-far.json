{"title":"Assam: Four injured in explosion in Guwahati, no casualties reported so far","content":"At least four people were injured in a bomb blast in Assam’s capital Guwahati on Saturday, reported Northeast Now. The injured, identified as Kalpa Jyoti Talukdar, Champu Kumar Das, Taifuddin Ahmed and Binita Das, were shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.United Liberation Front of Assam’s chief Paresh Baruah said his militant group was responsible for the attack, NorthEast Now reported. The explosion was meant to be a message to Hindu Bengali groups trying to settle illegal Hindu Bangladeshis in Assam, he told a local news channel over telephone. “These are people who stay in Assam but are conspiring against Assam and are trying to sabotage the NRC [National Register of Citizens] process,” he said. In July, the Assam government published the final draft of the National Register of Citizens, which excluded more than 40 lakh of 3.29 crore applicants. Several parties have protested against the publication of the draft list.Baruah expressed regret at the injuries and claimed that the site of the blast, which took place in Guwahati’s Panbazar area near the police station, was not intentional. Joint Commissioner of Police Diganta Borah said a bomb investigation squad is at the site, ANI reported. “A preliminary investigation rules out any sabotage activity,” Borah told reporters. “Further investigation is underway.” The police on Thursday had issued a security alert ahead of Durga Puja festival, reported The Times of India.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2018-10-13T13:25:55.638295+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/102950-llsnbyzrmb-1539417070.jpeg","tags":["Assam","Guwahati","Explosion"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/898147/assam-four-injured-in-explosion-in-guwahati-no-casualties-reported-so-far"}
