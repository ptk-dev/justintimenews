The yatra on a rath, or vehicle shaped like a chariot, took place in September and October 1990 from Gujarat’s Somnath to Ayodhya. Advani was arrested in Bihar. With thousands of supporters in tow, the yatra had triggered communal violence in its wake, especially in northern India.The Babri masjid, located in Ayodhya, was demolished by Hindutva extremists on December 6, 1992, because they believed that it stood on the spot on which the deity Ram had been born. The incident had triggered communal riots across the country. The Ram temple, which is still under construction, is being built on site of the razed Babri mosque.In September 2020, a special Central Bureau of Investigation court in Lucknow had acquitted Advani and 31 other accused in the nearly three-decades-old criminal case related to the demolition of the Babri masjid. They had been accused of criminal conspiracy.On January 23, socialist leader and former Bihar Chief Minister Karpoori Thakur was awarded the Bharat Ratna posthumously by President Droupadi Murmu. The announcement was made by the President’s Secretariat a day ahead of Thakur’s birth centenary on Wednesday. Thakur died in 1988.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-02-03T14:23:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/116758-xlxccysddw-1573308964.jpg","tags":["LK Advani","Bharat Ratna","Lal Krishna Advani"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1063145/bjp-leader-lk-advani-to-be-awarded-bharat-ratna"}
