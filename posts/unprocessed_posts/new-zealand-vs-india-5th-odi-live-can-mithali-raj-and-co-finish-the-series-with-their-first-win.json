{"title":"New Zealand vs India 5th ODI highlights: Half centuries for Mandhana, Kaur & Raj as India win","content":"Play\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Summary: Harmanpreet Kaur struck a much-needed half-century to get back among the runs as India, perhaps fielding closest to their best XI possible, managed to beat New Zealand in the series-ending fifth ODI for a six-wicket win in Queenstown on Thursday.The Indian bowlers, who under-performed prior to this game, finally clicked as an unit to limit New Zealand to 251 for nine in 50 overs.India chased the down the target in 46 overs courtesy Harmanpreet‚Äôs 63 off 66 balls and Smriti Mandhana‚Äôs 71 off 84 balls, while skipper Mithali Raj remained unbeaten on 57 off 66 balls to continue her great form with the bat.Having lost the one off T20 and first four ODIs, India badly needed a win to gain some momentum going into the ODI World Cup next month. The spinners, who struggled to provide the breakthroughs earlier, shared seven wickets among themselves on Thursday. Deepti Sharma, Rajeshwari Gayakwad and Sneh Rana took two wickets each while pacer Meghna Singh too was solid in the five overs she bowled.Star batter Mandhana, who had missed the first three ODIs and the T20 due to an extended stay in quarantine, also got some valuable time in the middle. India play their warm-up matches next against South Africa and West Indies, before beginning their World Cup campaign against Pakistan on Sunday.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    10.45 am: Stay tuned for highlights, but that will be all for live updates in this series.

(Still think they need a batting option down the order). She is a top order batter by trade, not a lower order enforcer... never been quite comfortable there. Better to have her batting in the first 30 more than trying to fit her in the last 20. It‚Äôs been a puzzle for this Indian management to fit her in the middle order and it‚Äôs been hit-and-miss. This could end up working rather well if they can add Pooja Vastrakar to the lower order (and she starts clicking with the bat). But for it to work, Deepti also has to bat with the kind of momentum Yastika was offering in this role. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India 44/1 after 6 overs: Leg byes galore in that Rowe over for India.
