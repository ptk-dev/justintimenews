The cut-off date is December 31, 2014. The amendments were approved by both Houses of Parliament this week and were signed into law by President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday night.Two people were killed in Assam and 21 were injured as demands to withdraw the changes to the 1955 law were raised. The widespread fear in the North East is that populations defined as indigenous to the region will be culturally and physically overrun by migrants as a result of these changes.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2019-12-13T18:59:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/132762-wiheqxxdff-1576242671.jpeg","tags":["Citizenship Act","Shillong","Meghalaya"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/946763/citizenship-act-protests-in-shillong-police-use-tear-gas-baton-charge-demonstrators"}
