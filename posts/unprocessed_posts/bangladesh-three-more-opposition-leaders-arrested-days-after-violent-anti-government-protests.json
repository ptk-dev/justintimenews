Hasina also accused Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia’s son of hiring killers to assassinate her, reported AFP. Human rights organisation Amnesty International on Monday said that expressing dissent against government is not a crime.“The repeated cycle of killings, arrests and repression in Bangladesh has deeply chilling implications on human rights in the country before, during and after the elections,” said Yasasmin Kaviratne, Amnesty International’s regional campaigner for South Asia. “Once again, Amnesty International urges the Bangladeshi authorities to stop the crack down on protesters and instead fulfil their duty to facilitate peaceful assemblies.”In April, Hasina had accused the United States of seeking a regime change in Bangladesh after Washington pulled up her party on issues related to human rights. In May, the US had announced that it will restrict visas to Bangladeshis who undermine the democratic election process in their own country.Also read: As elections loom, what did the violent rally by Bangladesh’s opposition party achieve?","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-11-03T20:41:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/195577-jscjtthyyu-1699023448.jpg","tags":["Sheikh Hasina","Bangladesh","Awami League","Bangladesh Nationalist Party","Dhaka","Elections"]}
