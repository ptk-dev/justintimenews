He also visited a relief camp housing members of the Kuki community and Meitei communities in Kangpokpi and Imphal.Many of those taking shelter in the relief camps accused the state government of being a mute spectator even as violence spread across Manipur. The home minister assured them of justice and all possible help, reported The Indian Express.Violence had first broken out in the state on May 3 after thousands participated in a protest march organised by the All Tribal Students’ Union of Manipur to oppose the demand of the majority Meitei community to be included in the Scheduled Tribe category.The protestors included the Kukis, one of the larger tribal communities in Manipur. For months now, they have been at loggerheads with the state government, and, in particular with Singh, who the community claims harbours Meitei “majoritarian” sentiments.In fresh violence on Wednesday night, three police personnel were injured in a gunfight with suspected Kuki militants in Manipur’s Bishnupur district, reported PTI. The gunfight took place in the district’s Tangjeng area.Meanwhile, the Manipur government has removed the state’s Director General of Police P Doungel.
