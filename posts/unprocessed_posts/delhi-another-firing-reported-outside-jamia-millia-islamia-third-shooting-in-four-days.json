SHO (Station house officer) is present at the spot. Investigation is on pic.twitter.com/EKlxQPBVum— ANI (@ANI) February 2, 2020\n\nOn Saturday, a gunman had fired bullets in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh locality, which has emerged as the epicentre of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. This came two days after a gunman shot a student near Jamia Millia Islamia while protestors were marching to the Gandhi memorial at Rajghat on the anniversary of the freedom struggle leader’s assassination. Over the past week, Bharatiya Janata Party leaders have made provocative remarks about protestors at Shaheen Bagh. Hours after a gunman fired shots at protestors outside the Jamia Millia Islamia University on January 30, Home Minister Amit Shah asked Delhi voters at an election rally if they were “with Modi or Shaheen Bagh?” Earlier, Union minister Anurag Thakur had led a crowd of BJP supporters in chanting the slogan “shoot the traitors”. Lok Sabha BJP MP Parvesh Verma claimed protestors at Shaheen Bagh would “rape and kill your sisters and daughters”. These instances of hate speech prompted the Election Commission to ban Thakur and Verma from campaigning for a few days. On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath appeared to suggest the use of bullets as a means to get dissenters on board.Hundreds of women, along with children, have been peacefully protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens at Shaheen Bagh since the middle of December. The law has been widely criticised as discriminatory and Indian Muslims fear it could be used along with the citizens’ register to harass and disenfranchise them.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2020-02-03T07:57:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/135802-tnjunawjkr-1580696545.jpg","tags":["Jamia firing","Jamia Millia Islamia","Delhi","Jamia shooting","CAA protests","Shaheen Bagh"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/951954/delhi-another-firing-reported-outside-jamia-millia-islamia-third-shooting-in-four-days"}
