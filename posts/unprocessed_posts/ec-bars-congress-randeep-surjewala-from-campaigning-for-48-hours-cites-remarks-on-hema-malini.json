Haryana will go to polls in the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha election on May 25.On April 9, the Election Commission issued a show-cause notice to Surjewala in response to a video that showed him making derogatory remarks about Malini. The Congress leader had, however, accused the BJP’s social media cell of distorting his statement. The poll panel, however, stated that the district election officer sent it a video of the speech and said it was convinced that the Congress leader made the statement in question.The Election Commission said it “strongly condemns the impugned statement made by him during election campaign held in Haryana and reprimands Shri Randeep Singh Surjewala for the above said misconduct”. The panel barred him from campaigning till 6 pm on April 18.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-04-17T13:03:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/175727-ibojdewglu-1655135173.jpg","tags":["Election Commission","Congress","BJP","Lok Sabha 2024","Randeep Surjewala","Hema Malini"]}
