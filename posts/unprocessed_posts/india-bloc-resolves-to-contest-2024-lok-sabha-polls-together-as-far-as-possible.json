The parties have also decided to organise public rallies across the country to raise matters of public concern and importance.“We, the INDIA parties, hereby resolve to coordinate our respective communications and media strategies and campaigns with the theme Judega Bharat, Jeetega India [India will unite, India will win] in different languages,” they added.The bloc has also formed four sub-groups that have separate responsibilities, reported the Hindustan Times. Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge has asked the members to form bullet points to devise the bloc’s common agenda.Meanwhile, Kharge, at a press conference, criticised the BJP-led Central government, accusing it of “playing vendetta politics”. “Yesterday, Shri Rahul Gandhi held a press conference here and questioned PM Narendra Modi’s silence on alleged stock manipulation by Adani Group,” the Congress chief said. “He demanded a JPC [joint parliamentary committee] probe into charges of round-tripping and reports of opaque investment from Mauritius-based company. It is unexplainable why the prime minister is not getting the matter investigated?”Gandhi had raised the demand after a report claimed that two individuals who opaquely pumped in millions of dollars into the Adani Group have close ties with its promoters.The Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project published a report on Thursday alleging that Chang Chung-Ling from Taiwan and Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli from the United Arab Emirates invested large sums of money through “opaque” investment funds based in Mauritius. This money was subsequently used to trade shares of four Adani companies between 2013 and 2018.The allegations from the report, for which The Financial Times and The Guardian collaborated with OCCRP, raise questions about the possible violation of Indian stock market rules.INDIA alliance has no vision, says BJPFollowing the meeting, BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the INDIA alliance does not have any vision for the country’s development, no roadmap for uplifting the poor, no strategy to address concerns of farmers or women and children, and no acknowledgment of the threat to the country “from terrorism, radicalisation and secessionist forces”, reported ANI.“Their only recurrent theme is to abuse Shri Narendra Modi ji,” he added.Union minister Piyush Goyal said that the alliance was made of “arrogant people” and so it cannot work for the development of the country, reported ANI. “They cannot rise above their arrogance, how will they serve the people?” he asked.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-09-01T16:38:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/193691-mxbolcuhpj-1693565628.jpg","tags":["INDIA bloc","2024 Lok Sabha elections","Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1055272/india-bloc-resolves-to-contest-2024-lok-sabha-polls-together-as-far-as-possible"}
