{"title":"Olympics: Thirty countries write to IOC disapproving inclusion of Russian athletes at Paris 2024","content":"Governments of more than 30 countries asked the IOC for  “clarification” on Monday over how Russian and Belarusian athletes would be  able to compete as neutral athletes in the Paris 2024 Olympics.Russia and its ally Belarus, which allowed its territory to be used  as a launchpad when Moscow began its invasion of Ukraine last February,  have been sidelined from most Olympic sports since the war began.The International Olympic Committee has said it is exploring a  “pathway” to allow Russian and Belarusian competitors to take part in  the Paris Games, under a neutral flag – sparking fury from Ukraine.But in a joint letter seen by AFP, the countries expressed concern  particularly given the “strong links and affiliations between Russian  athletes and the Russian military”.“We have strong concerns on how feasible it is for Russian and  Belarusian Olympic athletes to compete as ‘neutrals’... when they are  directly funded and supported by their states,” said the letter.It said that “these strong concerns need to be dealt with by the IOC.”The joint letter to the IOC follows a summit earlier this month in  London attended by France, Britain, the United States and Canada, among  others.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also spoke at the conference.“We firmly believe that, given there has been no change in the  situation regarding the Russian aggression in Ukraine... there is no  practical reason to move away from the exclusion regime for Russian and  Belarusian athletes set by the IOC,” the letter read.“As long as these fundamental issues and the substantial lack of  clarity and concrete detail on a workable ‘neutrality’ model are not  addressed, we do not agree that Russian and Belarusian athletes should  be allowed back into competition,” the letter concluded.","author":"AFP","time":"2023-02-21T10:20:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/187111-laytbvkhlg-1676953656.jpg","tags":["International Olympic Committee","IOC","War in Ukraine","Russia","Olympics","Paris 2024 Olympics","Belarus"]}
