Naidu said he had considered each of the five allegations against Misra “individually as well as collectively” and concluded that the notice did not “deserve to be admitted”.“The motion presented by the MPs indicates a mere suspicion, conjecture or an assumption in the Prasad Education Trust case,” says the order by Naidu. “The same does not constitute proof beyond a reasonable doubt required to make out a case of proved misbehavior.”Naidu said the allegations were not admissible. “The allegations emerging from the case have a serious tendency of undermining the independence of the judiciary,” Naidu said.
