Vegetable prices soared 37.3% compared with a decline of 0.93%  the previous month.Prices of spices rose to 21.63% in July from 19.19% in June. Cereal inflation increased to 13.04% from 12.7% in June.Last week, the Reserve Bank of India kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.50%.

Higher key lending rates translate into high interest on loans disbursed by commercial banks. This, in turn, keeps a check on discretionary spending by consumers.Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das had said that the spike in tomato prices and a rise in the prices of cereals and pulses has contributed to inflation. He added that going by past trends, vegetable prices were expected to fall in a few months.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-08-14T21:01:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/174388-exptreaboy-1652601419.jpg","tags":["retail inflation","Indian economy","Inflation"]}
