{"title":"‘Is this Bharat?’: Ed Sheeran remix at G20 airport welcome draws amusement, ire on social media","content":"As leaders of the G20 countries arrived in India on Friday for the organisation’s summit on Saturday, the song-and-dance welcome items at Delhi airport attracted surprise and exasperation. Coming in for special attention on Twitter was the decision to have a troupe dance to a remixed version of British musician Ed Sheeran’s 2017 hit Shape of You overlaid with Indian elements as US President Joe Biden alighted from his plane. Among other things, many questioned the appropriateness of the rather risque lyrics for the occasion.The same song greeted Argentine President Alberto Fernandes and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.Biden arrives in India as nearby band welcomes him with Ed Sheeran song “Shape of You” pic.twitter.com/Zy77W2ZpG0— Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) September 8, 2023\n\n “Embarrassing at the least,” tweeted Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate. We are welcoming foreign heads of state with ‘Shape of you’ by Ed Sheeran?!?!Lyrics that follow ‘Grab on my waist and put that body on me.…I’m in love with your body. Last night you were in my room. And now my bedsheets smell like you’Embarrassing at the least 📷 @ANI pic.twitter.com/YYAB7bihlV— Supriya Shrinate (@SupriyaShrinate) September 8, 2023\n\nHere are some other reactions.Ed Sheeran's Shape of You is part of our culture now? 🤷🏻‍♀️If you sprinkle some \"sa ni dha pa\" over it like salt, it doesn't make it cultural either. 🤷🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/wffLBHpdW8— Narayani Basu (@narayani_basu) September 8, 2023\n\nIndia has thousands of years of musical tradition, across such a wide breadth of languages, regions, and culture… and so the obvious G20 welcome song was Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” https://t.co/5bpb0ZOcFE— Karan Madhok (@KaranMadhok1) September 9, 2023\n\npic.twitter.com/teXRm6WZA0— Siddharth (@DearthOfSid) September 9, 2023\n\nTill last week we were debating Bharat and British Invasion, then why these British Ed Sheeran songs??? Is this Bharat??? https://t.co/Ea6OX2TH9p— DoctorSid (@SidhaantNangia) September 9, 2023\n\nFor all of the BJP's nationalist posturing, at heart they and Modi are incredibly insecure and pining for Western approval. So during the G20 actual Indians in Delhi get their settlements bulldozed, while foreigners are shown a garbage Carnatic remix dance of Ed Sheeran. https://t.co/QlSCg6kT1l— HHH_Report (@HHH_Report) September 8, 2023\n\nIt is so disturbing to watch dancers dancing on a stage near the tarmac to welcome international leaders. From all that I have seen, they all seem to be young girls.  This is so degrading!— T M Krishna (@tmkrishna) September 9, 2023\n\nWhich culture? Why are these people dressed in traditional clothing but in that disgusting colour dancing to some remix of what sounds like Ed Sheeran?Also, what's with this new trend of having an Annual Function Day tier dance show everytime some head of state visits? https://t.co/Wu3H4Y3L07— Sawai (@HHMaharajaSawai) September 9, 2023\n\nOther welcome items also drew some adverse reactions.Surprised to this horrendous presentation of our beloved Bihu dance welcoming Hon’ble PM of England @RishiSunak during G20. @IndiaG2O #G20Bharat #Bihu @himantabiswa @BimalBorah119 pic.twitter.com/xTMYKYU6z0— Shyamkanu Mahanta (@skmahanta2013) September 8, 2023\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with our diplomats? Is there no input and background done on guest’s culture sensitivity?The Oman head of state looked awkward and left abruptly.  pic.twitter.com/Pdrvd8CGVf— Supriya Shrinate (@SupriyaShrinate) September 8, 2023\n\nBut at least one delegate seemed to enjoy the beats.Difficult to resist #Sambalpuri beats .
