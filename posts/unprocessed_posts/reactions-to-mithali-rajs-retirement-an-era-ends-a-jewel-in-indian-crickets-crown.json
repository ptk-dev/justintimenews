Women were often taught cricket in the most technically correct way, even as male cricketers had long since moved on from picture perfect techniques. And Mithali was really the MCC Coaching manual in human form.— Jarrod Kimber (@ajarrodkimber) June 8, 2022\n\nOnly if people saw how good she was in her prime.
