The Gautam Adani-led group of companies will launch an open offer to acquire another 26% in the media house.According to rules of the Securities and Exchanges Board of India, an entity that acquires more than a 25% stake in a company gets the right to announce an open offer to the shareholders of the target company inviting them to sell their shares at a specific price.NDTV said in a statement that the notice about acquisition was served without “input from, conversation with, or consent of” the founders of the channel.In an e-mail sent to employees of the media group on Tuesday, Suparna Singh, the head of NDTV Convergence Limited said that the acquisition was “entirely unexpected”.“This acquisition was made without their [Radhika and Prannoy Roy] consent or without any sort of notice,” Singh said. “We are in the process of evaluating the next steps, many of which involve regulatory and legal processes.”How did the acquisition happen?On Tuesday, Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited, a subsidiary of the AMG Media Networks Limited, acquired 99.5% of the 29.18% stake in NDTV held by Roys through RRPR Holding Private Limited, Adani Enterprises said in a press release.

According to terms of the loan, Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited held the right to exercise its warrants and convert the loan amount into equity shares. A warrant is a security that grants a lender the right to buy stocks in a company for a fixed price till a date decided upon while lending the amount.Seems like a 12 year old loan to the promoters of NDTV has been converted into equity resulting in the 29% stake, which has triggered the open offer now https://t.co/QNb2Vbdwcd pic.twitter.com/gU91kyMoZt— Madhav Chanchani (@madhavchanchani) August 23, 2022\n\nThe Adani Group has made an open offer to buy a further 26% stake in NDTV at Rs 294 per share, which will mean a total amount of Rs 493 crore, Mint reported.The development came just a day after NDTV wrote a letter to the National Stock Exchange dismissing as a “baseless rumour” speculation that shares held  individually by co-founders Radhika and Prannoy Roy and through their company RRPR Holding Private Limited were being sold.“Radhika and Prannoy Roy are not in discussions now, nor have been, with any entity for a change in ownership or a divestment of their stake,” the company had said in a regulatory filing to the exchanges on Monday.AMG Media Networks Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Pugalia said that the acquisition “is a significant milestone in the journey of AMNL’s goal to pave the path of new age media across platforms”.“With its leading position in news and its strong and diverse reach across genres and geographies, NDTV is the most suitable broadcast and digital platform to deliver on our vision,” Pugalia said.In the financial year 2021-’22, NDTV made revenues of Rs 421 crore, earned a net profit of Rs 85 crore and has negligible debt, a press release from the Adani Group said.On Tuesday, NDTV shares closed at Rs 366.20 apiece, up by 2.61%, on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
