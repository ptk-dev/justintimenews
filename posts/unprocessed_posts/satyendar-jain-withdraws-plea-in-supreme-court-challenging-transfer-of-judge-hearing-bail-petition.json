The complaint had accused him of having laundered money through four companies allegedly linked to him.On September 23, a Delhi sessions court had replaced Judge Gitanjali Goel, who was previously hearing the case against Jain, with Special Judge Vikas Dhull on September 23 on the Enforcement Directorate’s request.While hearing bail pleas of the Aam Aadmi Party leader and two of his alleged aides, Goel had rebuked the Enforcement Directorate about its investigation in the case.Goel had asked why the Enforcement Directorate went beyond the CBI’s case to look into alleged proceeds of crime that are not mentioned in the chargesheet. She had also sought to know what exactly the crime in the case was, observing that the companies allegedly cheated by Jain were also named as accused entities. Following Goel’s transfer, Jain had moved the Delhi High Court, which dismissed his plea saying that the principal district and sessions judge had considered all facts while transferring the case and that the order did not need any interference.Jain had then moved the Supreme Court, which on October 11, issued notice to the Enforcement Directorate on Jain’s petition, reported Live Law.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-10-17T17:18:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/175960-yiscmmiole-1655537610.jpg","tags":["Satyendar Jain","Enforcement Directorate","AAP","Supreme Court"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1035223/satyendar-jain-withdraws-plea-in-supreme-court-challenging-transfer-of-judge-hearing-bail-petition"}
