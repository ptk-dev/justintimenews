{"title":"Get any investigation done against Robert Vadra, Congress tells government","content":"The Congress party on Tuesday said the government should get “any investigation” done into allegations against party President Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra, PTI reported. Vadra has been going through a witch-hunt for the last 41 months, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said.Earlier in the day, the Bharatiya Janata Party had asked Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi to break their silence over reports alleging that Vadra had links with fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari. Their silence would be construed as acceptance of the charges, said Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Times Now claimed on Monday that Bhandari had booked business-class tickets for Vadra in 2012. Sitharaman also raised the issue of Vadra’s London flat, which is said to be refurbished by Bhandari in 2016.In response, Surjewala said: “...Modiji has been in power for 41 months...They have a government in Haryana and Rajasthan, and by all means, conduct any investigation that you choose, and come to a conclusion through a free and fair process of law of any wrong-doing.”He said the BJP had not arrived at any conclusion yet on violation of any law by Vadra.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2017-10-17T21:16:56.513583+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/854482-35643-kaskgokjns-1503468168.jpg","tags":["Robert Vadra","Congress","Bharatiya Janata Party"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/854482/get-any-investigation-done-against-robert-vadra-congress-tells-government"}
