Reuters/Danish SiddiquiThe images of Reuters photographers documenting funeral pyres burning round-the-clock and cremation grounds running out of space during the second wave showed the devastation the coronavirus wreaked across India’s cities and villages.Hospitals across the country also experienced oxygen shortages, with some forced to approach courts due to lack of supplies.Residences surround the grounds of a crematorium during a mass cremation for victims of the coronavirus disease in New Delhi on April 22, 2021.

The corpses were suspected to be of Covid-19 patients whose final rites could not be performed at crematoriums due to the huge rise in deaths at the time.A healthcare worker administers a dose of Covid-19 vaccine during a vaccination drive in Kashmir's Anantnag district on June 10, 2021. Reuters/Sanna Irshad MattooThe Centre was widely criticised for its handling of the Covid-19 crisis. However, it claims that states did not specifically report any deaths due to oxygen shortages during the period.Last week, the World Health Organisation said that more than 47 lakh citizens of India are thought to have died of coronavirus till the end of 2021. The Indian government denied the WHO’s claims saying that the methods used to determine excess deaths by the United Nations body were questionable.The toll estimated by the WHO is nearly 10 times more than the official number. The Union Health Ministry has claimed that 4,81,000 citizens have died between January 2020 and December 2021.A woman presses the chest of her father, who was having difficulty breathing, after he felt unconscious while receiving oxygen support at a Gurudwara in Ghaziabad on April 30, 2021.
