{"title":"Election watch: EC clears Narendra Modi in poll code violation case for sixth time this week","content":"9.10 pm: Here are the day’s top updates:\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    The Election Commission cleared Prime Minister Narendra Modi of charges levelled in a complaint against his April 21 speech in the city of Patan in Gujarat. This is the sixth time this week that the prime minister has been cleared in a Model Code of Conduct violation case.The Aam Aadmi Party blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was slapped during a road show in Moti Nagar in the New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency. The BJP, however, alleged that the AAP had scripted the incident.   Congress leader and former Union minister P Chidambaram claimed that an election commissioner’s dissent from the poll panel’s decision to clear Prime Minister Narendra Modi in two cases of alleged poll code violation in Maharashtra indicates that “the fear of Modi-Shah” is finally weakening.   A video of Bharatiya Janata Party leader Varun Gandhi has gone viral on social media. In the video, Gandhi is seen targeting the candidate fielded by the Opposition alliance in Sultanpur constituency of Uttar Pradesh and his brother, saying he gets such people to untie his shoelaces.  Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah held a roadshow in Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, accompanied by Smriti Irani, the party’s candidate from the constituency. He said that in Uttar Pradesh the choice for voters was between dynasty and development, and predicted a win for Irani by one lakh votes. The constituency votes on Monday.The campaigning for the fifth phase of the Lok Sabha elections came to an end.Congress President Rahul Gandhi held a press conference in which he said he will stand by the slogan “chowkidar chor hai” against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He also said the Army was not Modi’s personal property, and criticised the prime minister for claiming that surgical strikes when the Congress was in power were like “video games”.\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    8.50 pm: The Election Commission has cleared Prime Minister Narendra Modi of charges levelled in a complaint against his speech in the city of Patan in Gujarat in which he had said he had kept Pakistan on its toes for the safe release of captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, reports PTI.Read more here:‘Qatal ki raat’: Narendra Modi says his warning forced Islamabad to send back captured IAF pilot\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    8.35 pm: Union minister and former Army chief VK Singh has taken a dig at the Congress for its claims about surgical strikes carried out by the armed forces during the UPA government’s time. “Congress has a habit of lying,” Singh said in a tweet earlier in the afternoon. “Will you please let me know which ‘so-called surgical strike’ are you attributing to my tenure as COAS [chief of Army staff]?”\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    Congress has a habit of lying.
