The Centre notified the rules under the Act on March 11.Hours after the rules were notified, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said that if individuals were sent to detention camps in the name of the Citizenship Amendment Act, the Trinamool Congress would “stop that ploy”.The Trinamool Congress has contended that those who apply for citizenship afresh under the Citizenship Amendment Act would become ineligible for Aadhaar-linked welfare schemes, and that their existing identification documents would become useless, The Times of India reported.On Saturday, Thakur, whose ancestors hailed from Bangladesh, said that he would apply under the Citizenship Amendment Act to counter the propaganda against it by the Trinamool Congress. “I want to see if I can be deprived of facilities after being applied for citizenship,” he added.Commenting on his statement, West Bengal minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said: “We are waiting when Shantanu Thakur will apply because as soon as he applies, his ministership goes as he is no longer a citizen of India.”","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-18T11:04:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/199332-mogisxmlwt-1710735191.jpg","tags":["Bharatiya Janata Party","West Bengal","Shantanu Thakur","Citizenship Amendment Act","Mamata Banerjee","Trinamool Congress"]}
