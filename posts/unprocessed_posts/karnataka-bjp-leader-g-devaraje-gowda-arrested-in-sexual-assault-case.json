He had written to BJP state president BY Vijayendra on December 8 cautioning the party against fielding Prajwal Revanna in the polls, reported The News Minute.After the videos – allegedly recorded by Prajwal Revanna himself – came to light on April 26, Gowda claimed that the Congress had leaked them.The BJP is contesting the general election in Karnataka in alliance with the Janata Dal (Secular).On April 1, a complaint was filed against Gowda at the Holenarsipur town in Hassan district by a woman who alleged that he had sexually assaulted her after assuring her of help in a legal matter. The police had subsequently issued the BJP leader a notice.Gowda was taken into custody on Friday in connection with the woman’s complaint, The Hindu quoted an unidentified police officer as saying.
