With 17 needed off the last over, Jonassen and Arundhati Reddy combined to inflict a run-out. She struck two big hits to bring the equation down to 2 off 1.A fatigued Ghosh was eventually run-out and could not make it through to her last run.Earlier, Jemimah Rodrigues put up yet another commanding show as she scored a 36-ball 58 to propel Delhi to a competitive 181/5 in the first innings.Rodrigues employed sweeps, cuts, pulls and a superb inside out lofted drive, accumulating 97 runs in just 10.1 overs for the third wicket with Alice Capsey (48 off 32 balls).Capsey, who initially let the Indian take more of the strike, upped the ante during the death overs.Openers Shafali Verma (23) and Meg Lanning (29) contributed 54 to the opening partnership. However, they were both bowled in quick succession by Asha Sobhana and Shreyanka Patil respectively.Off-spinner Patil took four wickets for 26 in four overs and was outstanding at the conclusion of the Capitalsâ€™ innings, putting a stop to the home teamâ€™s score. She dismissed the well-set Rodrigues, Capsey and then had Jonassen beaten for one in the final over.Capitals, with their fifth win, are now on 10 points and lead the table.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-10T23:45:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/199152-moxflrtokp-1710094544.jpg","tags":["Jemimah Rodrigues","Alice Capsey","Shreyanka Patil","Royal Challengers Bangalore","Delhi Capitals","Cricket","Richa Ghosh"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1064997/wpl-2024-delhi-capitals-clinch-thriller-against-royal-challengers-bangalore"}
