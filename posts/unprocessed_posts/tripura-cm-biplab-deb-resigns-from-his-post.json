It is not yet known why Deb resigned, but there has been discontent about his leadership among the party MLAs. In November, two BJP MLAs, Sudip Roy Burman and Asish Saha had criticised Deb and the state government for political violence ahead of the civic polls. They had alleged that there was no democracy in the state.  This was a month after nine party MLAs, led by Roy Burman, had come to Delhi to meet the top leadership of the BJP. They had complained about the “misrule and total dictatorship” of Deb. They were also unhappy with Deb’s management of the coronavirus in Tripura.Deb became the chief minister of Tripura in 2018 after the BJP and its ally, the Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura registered a landmark victory in the state, dislodging the 25-year-old Left Front government. In the 60-member Assembly, the BJP has 36 MLAs and the support of eight IPFT legislators.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-05-14T16:31:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/174360-fpdxeccvge-1652533426.jpg","tags":["Biplab Deb","BJP","Tripura"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1023899/tripura-cm-biplab-deb-resigns-from-his-post"}
