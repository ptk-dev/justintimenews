The mall authorities had put up flags of all countries contesting in the ongoing cricket World Cup.In her post, Nataraj also claimed that the photo was from the Lulu Mall in Bengaluru. She tagged Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar asking him to boycott the mall, according to India Today.However, fact checkers pointed out that the photo was from a mall in Kochi and the Pakistani flag appeared bigger and placed above the Indian flag due to the angle from which the picture had been clicked.It all depends on how you see it. How to take a photograph. Which angle is the photograph taken from, which floor are you taking the pic from..
