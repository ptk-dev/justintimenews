He said that the Union government has assured that the language, cultural history and economic and political aspirations of Tripura’s tribal community will be given importance.Debbarma had launched a fast-unto-death protest on February 28 to demand a permanent solution to the problems faced by the state’s tribal community, The Indian Express reported.One of the TIPRA Motha’s demands has been a separate state for the state’s tribals where they are in the majority. All details of the tripartite agreement signed on Saturday were not immediately known.Shah said that the Narendra Modi government has signed 11 peace and boundary settlement agreements in the North East states. He said that the agreement in Tripura is the last before the Lok Sabha elections.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-02T16:42:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/198938-rkaxibloln-1709377773.jpg","tags":["Tripura","Tripura Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance","TIPRA","Tribals"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1064594/centre-tripura-and-tipra-motha-sign-pact-to-address-tribal-communitys-grievances"}
