This must be broken. Truth must prevail. Tamizhagam is a more appropriate word to call it. The rest of the country suffered a lot of devastation at the hands of foreigners for a long time.”On this, the DMK, in an article in its mouthpiece Murasoli, asked whether the name Rajasthan sounded like Pakistan or Afghanistan to the governor. “Isn’t Maharashtra a secessionist name for its name indicates the land of Marathas?” the article asked.However, the BJP state president K Annamalai accused the DMK of wanting to bury its “sececcionist past”, according to The Indian Express.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-01-09T13:34:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/143566-nnvrqcimzb-1593366808.jpg","tags":["Tamil Nadu","DMK","RN Ravi","Tamil Nadu Assembly"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1041486/tamil-nadu-dmk-allies-protest-against-governor-in-assembly-for-his-remarks-about-states-name"}
