Outside Parliament, a man and a woman had opened smoke canisters.Earlier in the day, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party wanted to establish a “single party rule” in the country and Opposition MPs were being suspended for that reason.“They [Modi and the BJP] talk of ‘Ek Akela’ which is akin to demolishing democracy,” Kharge said in a social media post. “This is precisely what they have done by suspending Opposition MPs.”While more than 140 Opposition legislators have been suspended because they wanted a statement from the Union home minister on the security breach in Parliament, the BJP MP who facilitated the entry of the intruders on December 13 remains scot-free and has not been questioned, Kharge said.On Tuesday, after suspension of the Opposition MPs from the Lok Sabha, Union Home Minister Amit Shah came to the Lower House and moved a motion to discuss three crucial bills replacing the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the Indian Evidence Act.Also read: ‘Rules for suspension are meant for individual MPs, not by the bulk’: Lok Sabha ex-secretary general","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-12-20T15:44:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/196781-gxisdvjvxb-1702996339.jpg","tags":["Parliament","Lok Sabha","Opposition"]}
