This is the only allegation of rape to emerge from the case, Rehman told reporters on Saturday.“Shibu [Shiba Prasad] Hazra has been arrested,” Trinamool Congress spokesperson Kunal Ghosh was quoted as saying by The Indian Express. “However, the arrest does not prove that all such allegations against him are true. The Opposition is trying to politicise the issue by raising several complaints.”#WATCH | Sandeshkhali violence | HM Rehman, SP Basirhat says, \"Shibu Hazra has been arrested from the Najat area of ​​Basirhat in West Bengal.

A mob allegedly attacked them with stones, bricks and batons when they had arrived at the Trinamool leader’s home.Women from the area subsequently alleged that Sheikh and his associates used to survey homes in the village, looking for young women whom they would take to the party office and sexually assault.The protesting women on February 9 burnt down three poultry farms owned by Hazra, which they claimed were built on land forcibly grabbed from locals.The next day, Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which bans the assembly of four of more persons, was imposed in different pockets of Sandeshkhali. Internet shutdown was ordered in 16 panchayats.On Thursday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party for fomenting trouble in the village. Claiming that Sandeshkhali had been a “hotbed of communal riots” in recent years, the chief minister stated that her administration had implemented necessary steps to restore peace in the area.While speaking in the Assembly, Banerjee alleged that a “sinister design is at play” to foment trouble in Sandeshkhali.The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to consider listing a public interest litigation seeking a court-monitored investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation or a special investigation team into the reports of sexual assault from Sandeshkhali.The National Commission for Women, which sent a fact-finding team to Sandeshkhali to probe the sexual assault allegations, said in a report released on Thursday that it found a “distressing pattern of negligence and complicity” by the West Bengal government and law enforcement officials.It said that the women who “dared to speak” against the assault faced retaliation in terms of property confiscation, “arbitrary arrests of male family members, and future acts of brutality”.On Saturday, a delegation of State Commission for Protection of Child Rights also visited Sandeshkhali in response to complaints of child abuse in the area, reported The Indian Express.On February 9, a seven-month-old child was allegedly snatched from her mother and thrown away by some persons, according to the villagers.“We spoke with the district administration and district health officials,” state child rights panel advisor Sudeshna Roy told the newspaper. “The family’s security will be ensured by district administration, they said a police personnel will be deputed in front of the house. Treatment of the child will also be ensured.”","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-02-18T09:24:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/198556-ztncsejkwq-1708228229.jpeg","tags":["Shiba Prasad Hazra","Sandeshkhali","Shahjahan Sheikh","West Bengal Police","sexual assault","Trinamool Congress","Mamata Banerjee","West Bengal"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1063888/sandheshkhali-violence-tmc-leader-shiba-prasad-hazra-arrested-in-sexual-assault-case"}
