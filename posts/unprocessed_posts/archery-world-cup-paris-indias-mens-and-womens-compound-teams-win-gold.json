On that occasion in Berlin, the Indian trio registered a solid 235-229 win over the Mexican team of Andrea Becerra, Ana Sofia Hernandez Jeon and Dafne Quintero. That medal was the first time India had won a senior World Championships gold.In Paris, on Saturday, the Mexicans came out in much better form. Both teams were locked at 59-59 in the first end, before India took a slender 118-117 lead in the second end.By the third end, the conditions became difficult as it started to rain, but the Mexican trio adjusted well to take a 176-175 lead after an end score of 59-57.Trailing by a point in the decider, the world champions though would not back down. Under windy and rainy conditions, they shot a solid 59 out of a possible 60 to better Mexico’s 57, and take the gold medal with a final score of 234-233.#Archery #ArcheryWorldCup Just a few weeks after Jyothi Vennam, Parneet Kaur and Aditi Swami won the World Championships gold medal in the women's compound event, they follow it up with a win at the Paris World Cup.https://t.co/4jClauStwO pic.twitter.com/IS5iGwtdRD— The Field (@thefield_in) August 19, 2023\n\n“We are feeling very good because this is the first time we’re winning gold in the World Cup,” Vennam said to World Archery after the match.“We’re feeling proud because we did this just after winning the World Championships.”A short while later, it was the Indian men’s turn to take to the range, coming up against the American team of Kris Schaff, James Lutz and Sawyer Sullivan.The Americans came out of the blocks in good form, scoring a perfect 60 against India’s 59 to take an early lead.The Indians however, levelled proceedings in the second end, scoring 59 to the Americans’ 58 to make it 118-118. There was nothing to separate the two teams in the third end either, with both teams locked at 176-176 after shooting 58 apiece.In the final end though, while the Americans stuttered, scoring 56, the Indians finished with a perfect 60 to secure the medal.#Archery #ArcheryWorldCup The men's team complete the double after the women's compound team won gold.https://t.co/4jClauStwO pic.twitter.com/Y9EHSYy2H6— The Field (@thefield_in) August 19, 2023\n\nIn the women’s individual compound event, Vennam lost to Great Britain’s Ella Gibson in the semi-final. Vennam shot two 9s over the five ends to finish with a good score of 148. Gibson, who beat Vennam in the final at the same venue last year, shot a perfect 150 to reach the final.In the final, Vennam was up against Lopez who she had beaten in the Antalya World Cup final. Vennam got off to a shaky start where she shot four 9s in the first three ends to give Lopez an 88-86 lead.The Indian held her nerves in the remaining two ends and shot 60 out of 60 to put the pressure on Lopez. The Colombian obliged by shooting two 9s with her final two arrows to take the match into a shoot-off.#Archery #ArcheryWorldCupJyothi Surekha Vennam holds her nerves to beat Sara Lopez and clinch a bronze medal in Paris!pic.twitter.com/eUsTQoFtHV— The Field (@thefield_in) August 19, 2023\n\nVennam and Lopez both shot 10s but Vennam clinched the bronze by virtue of shooting her arrow closest to the centre.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-08-19T15:59:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/193319-jufdtgsevu-1692440942.jpg","tags":["Jyothi Vennam","Parneet Kaur","Aditi Swami","Ojas Deotale","Prathamesh Jawkar","Abhishek Verma","Archery World Cup","Archery World Cup Paris","Archery"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1054564/archery-world-cup-paris-indias-mens-and-womens-compound-teams-win-gold"}
