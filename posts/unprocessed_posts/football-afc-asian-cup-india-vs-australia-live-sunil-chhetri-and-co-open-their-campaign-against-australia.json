We will be back once again on January 18 for India’s second match of the tournament when they take on Uzbekistan. But there is still plenty of action from Indian sport.

In Australia, the Indians were playing an opponent that had won the continental contest in 2015 and is a regular at the Fifa World Cup.Australia dominated possession and created chances aplenty. But the Indian defence stayed firm, often through confident tackles and sometimes with a few desperate stabs at the ball.Eventually it came down to an error by Gurpreet Singh Sandhu that led to the breakthrough, scored by Jackson Irvine. It was followed up by some wonderful work from Australia’s substitutes Riley McGree and Jordan Bos to double the lead and hand the Socceroos the win.For all their early work in the counter-attack, India’s frontline could not find a way back into the game.Up next for the Indians will be the match against Uzbekistan, on January 18.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    ⏰ FT | 🇦🇺 Australia  2️⃣-0️⃣ India 🇮🇳Socceroos dominate the pitch, securing a convincing victory and claiming their maiden 3 points in Group B 👏🏼#AsianCup2023 |  #HayyaAsia |#AUSvIND pic.twitter.com/TJ9Css6YYt— #AsianCup2023 (@afcasiancup) January 13, 2024\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    FULL TIME!\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Six minutes of stoppage time\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    88 min – India 0-2 Australia: McGree and Bos combined once again to nearly extend the Socceroos' lead. Good pass from McGree towards an unmarked Bos on the left.

The substitutes combine to give Australia a two-goal lead. Riley McGree floated down the right flank and effortlessly charged past Apuia. From a tight angle, he played a neat and accurate cross that evaded goalkeeper and defender and came neatly to Jordan Bos to slot home his first goal for the senior national team.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    70 min – India 0-1 Australia: Australia's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan has spent most of his time outside his box, given his team's dominance. But his positioning even caught his teammates off guard. A pass back from near the halfline went beyond Ryan and rolled towards the empty net. The goalkeeper did chase, but the ball had enough side-spin to move off target. That would have been a bizarre goal if it did happen. But India would have taken it.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    65 min – India 0-1 Australia: For all of their possession, Australia has been lacking in the final third.

Australia grabbed possession from India barely a few seconds after kickoff and continued to create chances. But the goal eventually came from what really was a non-chance. Martin Boyle's cross from the right had Gurpreet Singh Sandhu come off his line but tamely paw it into the direction of an unmarked Jackson Irvine, who controlled on his chest and shot into the net to put Australia in the lead.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    AND WE’RE OFF AGAIN!\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Australia had over 71% possession, had 12 corners to India’s zero, has 12 shots at goal to India’s one.

There have been a few defensive hiccups, but the Indian defence has just about managed to hold firm in what has otherwise been a disciplined performance.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    20 min – India 0-0 Australia: And now Australia let a golden chance go begging. Martin Boyle chased after Gurpreet Singh Sandhu as the Indian goalkeeper tried to clear. But the clearance was weak went straight to an Australian player with Sandhu hopelessly out of position. The defence scrambled together to block angles. Connor Metcalfe got the shot away eventually, but somehow aimed it straight at Sandhu.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    15 min – India 0-0 Australia: What a chance for India! It seemed to have been a harmless, hopeful cross from the right with three towering Australian defenders in posistion to deal with the danger. But Harry Souttar mistimed his jump, and Sunil Chhetri darted in but his diving header went wide.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    10 min – India 0-0 Australia: India is trying to create chances on the counter-attack as Australia continues to hold most of the possession. The Australians though have steadily started to find their feet, making a few more inroads towards the Indian goal, but the defence has remained solid.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    5 min – India 0-0 Australia: As expected, the Australians have dominated possession but the best chance so far has come for India. On the counter attack, Chhangte floated in a beautiful inviting cross from the left which sailed just over Chhetri in the centre and bounced over Manvir Singh on the right flank.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    AND WE’RE OFF!\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    There is history already in this match, before a ball is kicked.
