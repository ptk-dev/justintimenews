Earlier this month, the state-run broadcaster telecast the film The Kerala Story.The film, directed by Sudipto Sen, was released on May 5. It claims to depict how women from Kerala were converted to Islam and recruited by the Islamic State terrorist group.A day before the film was broadcast, Kerala Chief Minister and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Pinarayi Vijayan said that the state-run broadcaster should withdraw its decision to air it, on grounds that the broadcast could ‚Äúexacerbate communal tensions‚Äù ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.Vijayan said that the film incited polarisation.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-04-19T10:03:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/200156-tlmuwtwgul-1713499148.jpeg","tags":["DD News","Saffron","Doordarshan","News television channel","logo"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1066815/saffronisation-of-doordarshan-after-dd-news-unveils-new-logo-social-media-users-express-alarm"}
