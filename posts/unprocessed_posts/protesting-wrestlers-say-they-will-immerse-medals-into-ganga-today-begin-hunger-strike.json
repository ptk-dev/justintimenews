We are with truth and as farmers’ agitation had shown, sooner or later victory will be of truth.”The farmer leader said that a khap meeting will be held on Wednesday, reported ANI. “Entire Indian government is saving one man [Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh],” he added. #WATCH | Naresh Tikait arrives in Haridwar where wrestlers have gathered to immerse their medals in river Ganga as a mark of protest against WFI chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh over sexual harassment allegations.

She was barely two kms away from us but said nothing about our plight. Then we thought, should we return them to the prime minister, who calls us his daughters? But no, not once has he asked us how we have been doing since we started protesting. In fact, the man we are protesting against, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh was invited to the inauguration of the new Parliament.”Several Opposition leaders criticised the police action, saying it was “extremely shameful and unfortunate”. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that Modi was “crushing the people’s voice on the streets” after the inauguration of the new Parliament.The wrestlers statement added, “Have the female wrestlers committed a crime by asking for justice against sexual harassment? The Police and the government are treating us like criminals, while the accused person is openly rebuking us. He is openly talking about changing the POCSO act. After seeing all this we wonder why we win medals in Olympics and World Championships? Did we win so that the government could treat us in a pathetic manner, drag us and then declare us criminals?”English translation of the letter posted by Bajrang Punia, Sakshi Malik and Vinesh Phogat. \"The correct place to leave our medals is in holy Ma Ganga and not in an unclean system that after using us as a mask and taking advantage of us now stands in support of our harasser. pic.twitter.com/9bDNj6zr26— jonathan selvaraj (@jon_selvaraj) May 30, 2023\n\nAlso read: Wrestlers protest shows how Indian law is a tool of oppression rather than an instrument of justiceThe athletes were released after their detention. Broadcaster NDTV quoted a senior police official who said “all protesters were detained and forcefully boarded in buses” because they had “violated law and order”. Punia had then refuted the police’s allegations that the protestors broke barricades and violated law and order.“At a time when the authorities should focus on arresting the accused person, the police and the administration has been after female wrestlers who had to hide in the fields,” the wrestlers said. “There is no meaning left of these medals that once decorated us. We are anguished when we think of returning these medals, but how can we compromise with our self-respect?”#WrestlersProtests | What does this say about a country that proclaims proudly that “Bharat ki betiyan” (India’s daughters) are empowered?Read more: https://t.co/ZdoXRJWBbO@shahidthejudge writes. @thefield_in [Photos Arun Thakur/AFP] pic.twitter.com/AVYyZJTL9i— Scroll.in (@scroll_in) May 30, 2023","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-05-30T13:45:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190760-ipvosmelny-1685452231.jpg","tags":["Vinesh Phogat","Sakshi Malik","Bajrang Punia","Wrestling","Wrestlers protest"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1050052/protesting-wrestlers-say-they-will-immerse-medals-into-ganga-today-begin-hunger-strike"}
