The outcome of the upcoming Assembly elections later this year will determine not only the state’s future but also India’s.Gujarat is the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Hindutva lab and the party has been in power for an incredible 27 years. But how does a state obsessed with dhandho or commerce, reconcile its emotive support for Hindutva with the substantial economic setbacks India has seen over the past few years? That is the big question that Scroll.in’s Arunabh Saikia will be looking to answer as he criss-crosses the state for two months, travelling more than a thousand kilometres. Scroll.in’s trademark, in-depth reportage will cut through the noise of mainstream media and closely look at the political economy of Gujarat and how it will drive the state election.
