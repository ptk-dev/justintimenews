{"title":"Australian Open 2024 MD Final as it happened: Bopanna scripts history, wins title with Ebden","content":"That‚Äôs it from us! Thank you for joining us!A special day for Rohan Bopanna. To win a Grand Slam at 43 requires guts. To win it after contemplating retirement for the last few years takes something else. In Matthew Ebden, Bopanna has a partner who complements his big serving game nicely and expect more titles from the pair this year. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Rohan Bopanna on the message to people who believe that it is too late to achieve anything: Never to be in a hurry.

Bopanna scripts history to become the oldest player to win a Grand Slam title! There were nerves there as Ebden committed a double fault but he got over it to serve out the title.

But it is the Indo-Aussie pair who are first off the gates. They take a 5-0 lead before Ebden brings up six set points with an overhead smash at the net. Ebden seals the deal with a winner and the Indo-Australian pair one set away from a first Major as a pair. Bolelli and Vavassori had the momentum going into the tiebreak but Bopanna and Ebden were simply too good in the tiebreak.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Australian Open Men‚Äôs Doubles Final, Bolelli-Vavassori 6-6* Bopanna/Ebden (*denotes server): Incredible court coverage from Vavassori as he wraps up another quick love hold.

Vavassori scampers and sends in a dipping forehand which Bopanna volleys back weakly. Bolelli gets an easy winner. A superb return from Vavassori two points later. The Italian nets a slow Ebden second serve before Bopanna volleys straight at Bolelli to bring up game points. The Italians level the game. Vavassori brings up a break point by sending his return straight at Bopanna who cannot get his volley over the net. A big 190km/hr serve out wide and Ebden saves it. Superb from the Aussie to use the full court to bring up another game point. A double fault follows and we are back to deuce. Oh Bolelli comes up with an absolute peach of a forehand crosscourt winner which flew past Bopanna at the net and clipped the line. Ebden hangs on and serves a slow ace on his second serve to hold. That was a seven-minute game.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Australian Open Men‚Äôs Doubles Final, Bolelli-Vavassori 5-5* Bopanna/Ebden (*denotes server): Superb from Ebden! Vavassori‚Äôs volley does not have enough power which allows the Australian to get to it and he smacks a forehand which Vavassori cannot return. It‚Äôs 0-30 for the second seeds after Bopanna threads his opponent with a superb forehand at the net. At the next point, Ebden contorts his body mid-air to smack a forehand but cannot keep his next forehand in. A good volley from Vavassori to bring the game level before Bolelli rips a forehand. Vavassori smacks the ball high and Ebden somehow returns it in. Vavassori takes his time and sends a smash down the court to win the game.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Australian Open Men‚Äôs Doubles Final, Bolelli-Vavassori *4-5 Bopanna/Ebden (*denotes server): Good serving from Bopanna as the pair race to a 40-0 lead with only one of the serves being returned. Vavassori comes up with a seemingly no-swing, no-follow through backhand winner. Lovely return winner that. Bopanna then fires in a big ace down the line to wrap up another quick game.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Australian Open Men‚Äôs Doubles Final, Bolelli-Vavassori 4-4* Bopanna/Ebden (*denotes server): A good body serve from Vavassori to Bopanna sets up an easy put-away for Bolelli at the net and the pair repeat the trick at 30-0. Ebden nets his return and Vavassori wraps a quick love-hold. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Australian Open Men‚Äôs Doubles Final, Bolelli-Vavassori *3-4 Bopanna/Ebden (*denotes server): A quick hold to 15 from Ebden. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Australian Open Men‚Äôs Doubles Final, Bolelli-Vavassori 3-3* Bopanna/Ebden (*denotes server): Bolelli starts with a forehand winner before Vavassori catches Bopanna off guard with a volley at his legs. Superb defence from Bopanna and Ebden to stay and win the next point. Vavassori smashes a forehand high and though Ebden chases after it, his return goes long. Bopanna sends his return wide and the Italians hold.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Australian Open Men‚Äôs Doubles Final, Bolelli-Vavassori *2-3 Bopanna/Ebden (*denotes server): What a return from Bolelli!

Oh a superb backhand return from Bopanna on the next point. Vavassori can only find the net with his shot on the volley. Ebden defends well and Vavassori sends his overhand smash into the net. Luck goes the Indo-Australian pair‚Äôs way. A couple of quick exchanges at the net before Bopanna‚Äôs backhand flicks off the tape and catches Vavassori off guard and brings up a break point for the pair.
