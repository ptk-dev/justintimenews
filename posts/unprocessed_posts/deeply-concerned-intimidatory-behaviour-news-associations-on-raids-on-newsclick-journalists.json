{"title":"‘Deeply concerned’: News associations, Opposition condemn raids on ‘NewsClick’ journalists","content":"Several associations of journalists and news organisations as well as Opposition parties raised concerns on Tuesday about the Delhi Police’s raids on journalists associated with news website NewsClick.The police action on Tuesday morning was in connection with an investigation into the funding of NewsClick. The case registered in August was filed under provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 120B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.Among those raided were NewsClick’s editor Prabir Purkayastha, journalists Abhisar Sharma, Aunindyo Chakravarty and Bhasha Singh, and satirist Sanjay Rajaura. In Mumbai, similar action was being taken against activist Teesta Setalvad, who is the director of think tank Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research. The think tank has written articles for NewsClick.The Editors Guild of India urged the Centre to follow the due process and said the raids are yet another attempt to muzzle the media. “The investigation of specific offences must not create a general atmosphere of intimidation under the shadow of draconian laws, or impinge on the freedom of expression and the raising of dissenting and critical voices,” the association said in a statement.EGI is deeply concerned about the raids at the residences of senior journalists on the morning of October 3, and the subsequent detention of many of those journalists. Urges the state to follow due process, and not to make draconian criminal laws as tools for press intimidation pic.twitter.com/lHwOTi3XcS— Editors Guild of India (@IndEditorsGuild) October 3, 2023\n\nThe Press Club of India said it was “deeply concerned” about the raids. It asserted that it stood in solidarity with the journalists and urged the government to “come out with details” about the case.The Digipub News India Foundation, an 11-member digital-only news association, and the Mumbai Press Club also expressed deep concern.“They have been detained, their phones and laptops seized,” Digipub said in a social media post. “This is another instance of the government’s pattern of arbitrary and intimidatory behaviour. We are keeping an eye on developments.”DIGIPUB is deeply concerned about the raids at the homes of journalists connected with #Newsclick. They have been detained, their phones & laptops seized. This is another instance of the govt’s pattern of arbitrary &  intimidatory behaviour.

Intolerance is unworthy of everything that India represents. The government has disgraced itself and our democracy today.”Shocked to learn of the raids on 30 journalists in Delhi and arrests of several of them. These are not the actions of a “mother of democracy” but of an insecure and autocratic state.
