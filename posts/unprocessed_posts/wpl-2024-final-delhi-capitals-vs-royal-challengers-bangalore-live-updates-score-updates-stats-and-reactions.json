{"title":"WPL Final, Delhi vs Bangalore, as it happened: Royal Challengers win by 8 wickets to win first title","content":"That’s it for The Field’s coverage of the 2024 Women’s Premier LeagueWell, what an evening we have had. The Smriti Mandhana-led Royal Challengers Bangalore have been crowned the champions for the first time. They failed to make the playoffs in the inaugural edition last year, they had to play the eliminator this time around. But boy did they turn up in style when it mattered.As Mandhana said before lifting the trophy, “It is not Ee Sala Cup Namde, but Ee Sala Cup Namdu,” for RCB fans this time around.Even as we celebrate RCB, who have been the punching bag for trolls all these years, it is hard to not feel sad for the Delhi Capitals and Meg Lanning. They made it to their second final in as many years only to end on the wrong side of the result once again.The Capitals started well, racing away to 61/0 at the end of the powerplay after opting to bat first but that was the only joy they would have on Sunday at the Arun Jaitely Stadium. Sophie Molineux struck thrice in an over to pull RCB back in the contest and the Capitals never recovered.Molineux rightly walked away with the Player of the Match as well as the Royal Challengers Bangalore chased down the total with ease. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    #WPL2024 #WPLFinal #DCvsRCB    ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE ARE THE QUEEN'S OF THE WOMEN'S PREMIER LEAGUE 2024 🔥🏆📷 Jio Cinemahttps://t.co/SxQCWqE26C pic.twitter.com/gjDZMCjcrY— The Field (@thefield_in) March 17, 2024\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n        \n    \n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    RCB recieve their winners cheque of Rs 6 crore.“I am really proud of this bunch.
