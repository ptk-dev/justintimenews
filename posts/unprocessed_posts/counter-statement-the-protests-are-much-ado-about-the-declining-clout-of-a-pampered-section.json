{"title":"Joining the debate: 'The protests are about the declining clout of a pampered section'","content":"Full text of the statement \"petitioning right minded intellectuals and intelligentsia\" issued by a group of 36 eminent intellectuals, including Indian Council for Cultural Relations President Lokesh Chandra and noted writer SL Bhyrappa, that joins issue with a \"section of the usual pallbearers of Indic civilisation – Congressmen of various hues, Marxists, Leninists, even a handful of Maoist\" over \"perceived mounting intolerance in society\".\"The target,\" the statement says, \"is clear and explicitly stated - none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who much to their dismay led his party to a clear majority in Parliament. Failure in the elections is now sought to be avenged by other means; it helps if the media (or sections of it) serve as cheerleaders.\"India has witnessed a curious spectacle these last few weeks. A section of the nation’s intelligentsia has expressed outrage at a perceived mounting intolerance in society. In the forefront are the usual pallbearers of Indic civilisation – Congressmen of various hues, Marxists, Leninists, even a handful of Maoists. The target is clear and explicitly stated – none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who much to their dismay led his party to a clear majority in Parliament. Failure in the elections is now sought to be avenged by other means; it helps if the media (or sections of it) serve as cheerleaders.An initial joust was witnessed in accusations of attacks on Christian places of worship. It fizzled out when the actual culprits were nabbed.Then, the murder of a resident of Uttar Pradesh, allegedly because he consumed beef, is certainly condemnable, but how is the Central Government to blame? Uttar Pradesh is a state infamous for violence of every kind. Had the Centre intervened and dismissed the State Government under Article 356 of the Constitution, for failure to uphold law, the protest brigade would have found another stick with which to beat it. The murders of Mr. Dabholkar and Mr. Kalburgi happened in states not ruled by the BJP; yet loose language is bandied about.This same intelligentsia chooses not to remember that there has been no justice for victims of the anti-Sikh pogrom of 1984 and the farmers killed in Nandigram in 2007 under the Congress and Left governments respectively. In fact, when the CPIM led Left Front government, professing to serve the “proletariat”, fired upon and killed innocent farmers it was a constituent of the UPA-I at the Centre and a close partner of the Congress party. A similar silence followed when in 2010 the hands of professor T.J.Joseph, in then CPIM ruled Kerala, were chopped off, simply because of his belief and articulations. There are other sins of commission, too many to list.But the equation of the RSS with the terrorist Islamic State by an AMU scholar is simply breathtaking; it embarrassed intellectuals from his own community. As an eminent scholar of Islam he would be aware of its own recorded history and the ISIS’s self-documented abuse of human rights, including beheadings and wanton killings, not to mention rape, enslavement, et al.All in all, the protests are much ado about the declining clout of a pampered section.We therefore urge the people of India, who have repeatedly demonstrated great sagacity and wisdom, to not be diverted by a false narrative, and to focus, as they have done and continue to do, on the vision and aim of achieving unity, progress, growth and on seeing India become a great nation under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.1.      Dr. Lokesh Chandra, President ICCR2.      Professor SL Bhyrappa, author, novelist, National Professor, Sahitya Akademi National Fellow3.      Professor Kapil Kapoor, former Pro-VC JNU, Chancellor, Mahatma Gandhi Antar-rashtriya Hindi Viswavidyalaya, Wardha4.      Professor Dilip K.
