It said that the demands were made “considering large-scale wedding/social engagement on that day, which  may cause inconvenience to large number of people, various logistic  issues and may lead to reduced voters participation during poll”.The date for the counting of votes, December 3, remains unchanged. The results of other poll-bound states – Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Mizoram – will also be announced on the same day.As per the new schedule for Rajasthan, November 6 will be the last day to file nominations while November 9 will be the last day to withdraw candidature.
