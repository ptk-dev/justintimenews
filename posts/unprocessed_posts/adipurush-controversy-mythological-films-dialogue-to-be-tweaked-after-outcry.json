{"title":"‚ÄòAdipurush‚Äô controversy: Mythological film‚Äôs dialogue to be tweaked after outcry","content":"The makers of Adipurush announced in a statement on Sunday that they will rewrite portions of the dialogue and issue new versions of the film after it came in for intense criticism on its release on Friday.Om Raut‚Äôs adaptation of the Ramayana stars Prabhas, Kriti Sanon, Saif Ali Khan, Sunny Singh and Devdutta Nage. While the Hindi production and its dubbed versions have posted impressive box office figures (an estimated Rs 100 crore net earnings in Hindi alone over the weekend), Adipurush has been trolled on social media for Manoj Muntashir Shukla‚Äôs gangster film-style dialogue, the over-reliance on visual effects and its casting choices.In a statement, producer T-Series and Retrophiles stated: ‚ÄúAdipurush is garnering an overwhelming response across the world and is conquering hearts of audiences across all ages. Making this visual spectacle a memorable cinematic experience, the team decides to make alterations to the film‚Äôs dialogues ‚Äì valuing the input of the public and the audience. The makers are revisiting the said dialogues, ensuring to resonate with core essence of the film and the same will reflect in the theatres in the next few days.

Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) spokesperson  Priyanja Chaturvedi demanded a ‚Äúpublic apology‚Äù from the filmmakers.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel said on Saturday that his Congress government will ban the film if audiences demanded it. ‚ÄúBajrang Bali is made to speak the language of Bajrang Dal in this movie,‚Äù Baghel said. ‚ÄúWhy are people of those political parties who call them the custodian of religion silent on this movie? Why are BJP leaders who kept giving statements on The Kashmir Files and The Kerala Story silent on Adipursh?‚ÄùThe Aam Aadmi Party too weighed in on the row, with Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament Sanjay Singh stating, ‚ÄúThe dialogues are so derogatory like kapda tere baap ka, tel tere baap ka, jalegi bhi tere baap ki, teri bua ka bagicha hai kya jo hawa khane chala aya.

The Hindu Sena has objected to Adipurush on the ground that it ‚Äúhurts the sentiments of the Hindu community by depicting the religious leaders/characters/figures in an inaccurate and inappropriate manner‚Äù.
