{"title":"The Singh Project hopes to battle bias against Sikhs, one portrait at a time","content":"With their long beards, turbans and kirpans, Sikh men cut striking figures. But their distinctiveness has sometimes made them the target of prejudice and even violence. British photographers Amit Amin and Naroop Singh Jhooti aim to change those attitudes with their art.With The Singh Project, which will be exhibited next month at London's The Framers Gallery, Aim and Jhooti intend to \"capture the essence of modern Sikhism and to pay tribute to the beauty and variety of British Sikh men\".Their portraits feature British Sikhs from a variety of backgrounds and professions:  IT professionals, doctors, boxers, even fashion stylists and magicians. The Sikh men in these images \"have consciously embraced their religious symbols to make a positive affirmation of their faith while disregarding any previous fear or negativity\", said Amin and Jhooti.Today, they note, the turban and unshorn hair \"are symbols of revolution, non-conformity and style\".But their work isn't just about people who share their religion. \"If there is a deeper message about the project it’s not aimed specifically and Sikhs, but all faiths and religions,\" they said in an email message. \"The message is that being yourself is good.\"Here are some portraits from the campaign.Here's a video of Amit Amin and Naroop Singh Jhooti  explaining the ideas behind The Singh Project.","author":"Mayank Jain","time":"2014-10-25T01:30:35+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/685139-25fee657-c738-40aa-81d0-b0da911e5fb3.jpg","tags":[]}
