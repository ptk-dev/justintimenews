The conflict escalated after Israel began ground offensives on Gaza after Hamas attacked border areas on October 7. As reported by The Washington Post on Saturday, Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas are close to reaching an agreement facilitated by the United States. This would involve hostages being freed in Gaza in exchange for a five-day pause in hostilities. As of now, 239 people are believed to have been held hostage in Gaza. The ground offensive by Israel has included a blockade of the Palestinian territory, resulting in a massive humanitarian crisis where residents have been cut off from important resources like fuel, electricity and telecommunication facilities. Gaza residents have also been dealing with shortages of food, water and lack of access to healthcare.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-11-19T15:58:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/195987-anbqyxjvpz-1700389448.jpeg","tags":["Israel-Palestine war","ICC Men's ODI World Cup","India","Australia","Virat Kohli","Gaza conflict"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1059303/protestor-with-stop-bombing-palestine-t-shirt-invades-pitch-during-world-cup-final-in-ahmedabad"}
