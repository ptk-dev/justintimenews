Jasprit Bumrah took six for 61 – and was denied the wicket of Markram when the batsman, on 71, edged a drive and wicketkeeper KL Rahul could not hold a catch above his head.Markram defied a pitch with pace, extravagant seam movement and uneven bounce, on which the highest score of any of his teammates in either innings was 15.He hit 17 fours and two sixes, one of which, off Prasidh Krishna, sailed out of the ground and onto a railway line beyond square leg.The 29-year-old opening batsman was eventually  out caught at mid-off by Sharma off Mohammed Siraj attempting another big shot.Siraj set up India’s win when he took six for 15 as South Africa were bowled out for 55 before lunch on Wednesday.Twenty-three wickets fell on the first day.(Text from AFP)Highlights from Day 1\n\n\n    \n    Play\n\nHighlights from Day 2\n\n\n    \n    Play","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-01-04T18:13:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/197212-jplkogfxjh-1704372192.jpg","tags":["Aiden Markram","South Africa","India","Rohit Sharma","India tour of South Africa","Jasprit Bumrah","Cricket"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1061645/india-tour-of-south-africa-visitors-win-shortest-test-in-history-to-level-series"}
