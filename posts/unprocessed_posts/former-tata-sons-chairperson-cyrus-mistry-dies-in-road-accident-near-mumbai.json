However, he was removed from the post in October 2016, before being ousted from the board of Tata Sons in February 2017.Following this, Mistry was part of a corporate battle against Tata Sons, which had spanned over four years.He filed an appeal at the National Company Law Tribunal under Sections 241 and 244 of the Companies Act, 2013, alleging oppression of minority stakeholders and mismanagement in Tata Sons.In July 2018, the NCLT dismissed Mistry’s petition holding that the board of directors are competent to remove the chairperson and that no selection committee is required to remove the executive chairperson. Mistry then challenged the NCLT decision at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.On December 19, 2019, the NCLAT overturned the NCLT verdict and reinstated Mistry as the Tata Sons chairperson. It also held that the board meeting – where the decision to remove Mistry was taken – was illegal.Tata Sons and Ratan Tata challenged the NCLAT decision in the Supreme Court in January 2020, following which the court stayed the NCLAT order. Mistry, meanwhile, filed a counter-appeal in the Supreme Court in February 2020, submitting that the NCLAT order had failed to secure Shapoorji Pallonji Group “from any prejudicial conduct in the future”.In March 2021, the Supreme Court dismissed all appeals filed on the matter by Mistry and his minority stakeholder company Shapoorji Pallonji.Also read: Cyrus Mistry (1968-2022): How the outsider was chosen to lead the Tata Group when Rata Tata retired","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-09-04T16:40:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/133077-dozmjvlwgc-1576683312.jpg","tags":["Cyrus Mistry","Tata Sons","Maharashtra"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1032024/former-tata-sons-chairperson-cyrus-mistry-dies-in-road-accident-near-mumbai"}
