India put up a formidable total in the first match, thanks to key contributions from Richa Ghosh and Deepti Sharma, but were let down by their fielding (as well as bowling plans) as Beth Mooney played a masterful knock. The hosts, who are without a head coach at the moment, will be keen to bounce back tonight and build momentum as they prepare for the upcoming ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in South Africa.India vs Australia, 1st T20I as it happened: Beth Mooney stars as visitors win by 9 wickets\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India’s squad for the T20I series against Australia: Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Smriti Mandhana (vc), Shafali Verma, Yastika Bhatia (wk), Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma, Radha Yadav, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Renuka Singh Thakur, Meghna Singh, Anjali Sarvani, Devika Vaidya, S Meghana, Richa Ghosh (wicket-keeper), Harleen Deol.Net bowlers: Monika Patel, Arundhati Reddy, SB Pokharkar, Simran Bahadur.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Australia’s squad for the T20I series against India: Alyssa Healy (c), Tahlia McGrath (vc), Darcie Brown, Nicola Carey, Ashleigh Gardner, Kim Garth, Heather Graham, Grace Harris, Jess Jonassen, Alana King, Phoebe Litchfield, Beth Mooney, Ellyse Perry, Megan Schutt, Annabel Sutherland.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n     Schedule for the series (IST) \n    \n       Day     Date     Time   Match     Venue    \n    \n     Friday     9th December     Aus won by 9 wickets  1st T20I     DY Patil Stadium    Sunday     11th December     7 pm   2nd T20I     DY Patil Stadium   Wednesday     14th December     7 pm   3rd T20I     CCI     Saturday     17th December     7 pm   4th T20I     CCI     Tuesday     20th December     7 pm   5th T20I     CCI","author":"Aditya Chaturvedi","time":"2022-12-11T18:29:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/184203-qlsfkykxmq-1670763238.jpg","tags":["cricket","indian cricket","indian women's cricket team","india vs australia","harmanpreet kaur","alyssa healy"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1039513/india-vs-australia-2nd-t20i-live-score-updates-stats-reactions-harmanpreet-kaur-and-co-look-to-bounce-back-against-alyssa-healy-s-team"}
