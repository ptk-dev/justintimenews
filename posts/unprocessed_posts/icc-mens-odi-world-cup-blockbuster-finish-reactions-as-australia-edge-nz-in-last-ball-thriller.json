{"title":"ICC Men’s ODI World Cup: ‘Blockbuster finish’ – Reactions as Australia edge NZ in last-ball thriller","content":"Five-time champions Australia edged out gallant New Zealand by just five runs in a high-scoring ICC Men’s ODI World Cup thriller on Saturday.Australia piled up 388 all out as Travis Head top scored with 109 and fellow opener David Warner made 81. New Zealand battled hard with Rachin Ravindra making 116, Daryl Mitchell adding 54 and Jimmy Neesham supplying late fireworks with a 33-ball fifty.In a dramatic final over played out in the shadow of the Himalayas, New Zealand needed 19 to win.Trent Boult scampered for a single before Mitchell Starc donated five wides.Neesham, one of the stars of the 2019 final which New Zealand lost to England, then took six runs off the next three balls.However, attempting another two, he was run out from a fine throw by Marnus Labuschagne from the fence.That left Lockie Ferguson, who had injured his Achilles in the field, needing to perform the heroics off the last ball.Starc fired the ball in on a full length and Ferguson could only push it to the covers, leaving the Kiwis stranded on 383-9.The result left both sides with four wins and two defeats each and well-placed for the semi-finals.Here’s a look at the reactions to thriller in Dharamsala:Phewwwww.
