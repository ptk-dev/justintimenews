However, on July 30, the Delhi government withdrew the policy after Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena recommended an inquiry into it by the central agency.On September 1, Delhi reverted to its old liquor policy, under which only state-run stores are allowed to operate. According to the first information report, Arora was accused by the Central Bureau of Investigation of receiving a bribe of Rs 1 crore from a liquor manufacturer on behalf of Sisodia.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-12-03T11:15:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/183798-kslzctycjr-1670045254.jpg","tags":["K Kavitha","Delhi excise policy case","CBI","ED"]}
