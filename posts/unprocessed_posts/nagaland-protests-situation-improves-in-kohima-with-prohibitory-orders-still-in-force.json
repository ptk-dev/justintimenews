{"title":"Nagaland protests: Situation improves in Kohima with prohibitory orders still in force","content":"Several regions of Kohima returned to normalcy with shops, educational institutions, banks and other business establishments opening on Saturday, two days after the Capital city of Nagaland saw violent protests. However, government offices remained closed and state-run vehicles were off roads with prohibitory orders still in force in some areas, reported PTI. Besides, mobile internet and SMS services are still not functional. On February 2, members of tribal groups went on a rampage to demand the state government to rollback the 33% reservation for women in the local body elections. The civic polls were called off after two protestors were killed in police firing on Tuesday. Protests intensified on Thursday evening after Chief Minister TR Zeliang refused to resign from his post, as per their demand. Protestors vandalised government property and set vehicles on fire in the city. The Kohima Municipal Council building, Regional Transport office and the Excise Department office were destroyed by the angry mob. Five Army columns were deployed in the city. Civic polls in the state have been held up since 2004 on the issue of 33% reservation for women in urban local bodies, mandated by Article 243 (T) of the Constitution. Tribal groups have held that the reservations interfered with Naga customary laws and protections guaranteed to them under Article 371(A) of the Constitution.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2017-02-04T20:02:22.212523+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/828537-50788-caujlkxcle-1486218706.jpg","tags":["Kohima","Nagaland","Nagaland protests","Nagaland civic polls"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/828537/nagaland-protests-situation-improves-in-kohima-with-prohibitory-orders-still-in-force"}
