And then there was this last one. Today is officially the last day of  Tokyo 2020. The year 2020 was one of uncertainty for athletes around the world (and those involved with sport in general too) and there was so much that was up in the air around this time 12 or so months ago. Even a few months back, with the situation around the world (and in Tokyo) the way it was, none of us really knew what to expect. But, hey, here we are finally. From the end of July to start of September, from Olympic Games to Paralympics Games, we have made sporting memories to last a long time. Yes, sport will continue after today, and it would be an exaggeration to say too much more... but, what wouldn’t be an exaggeration is that, these Games will be missed. It was a brilliant ride. A lovely, timely reminder of why sport is special. And today is the final stop.","author":"Vinayakk MohanaranganAshish Magotra","time":"2021-09-05T06:03:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/163698-cefqrcvfyb-1630840453.jpeg","tags":["Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games","India at Tokyo Paralympics","Tokyo 2020","Paralympic Games","Avani Lekhara","Pramod Bhagat","Krishna Nagar"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1004600/india-at-tokyo-2020-paralympics-day-12-live-updates-badminton-shooting-in-focus-on-final-day"}
