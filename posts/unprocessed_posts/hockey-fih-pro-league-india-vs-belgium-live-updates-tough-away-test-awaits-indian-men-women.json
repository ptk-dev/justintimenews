{"title":"Hockey FIH Pro League, Belgium vs India as it happened: India men earn shootout bonus after thriller","content":"That’s it from us today. Join us for the matches tomorrow. The Indian women’s team plays Belgium at 17:30 hrs, followed by the men’s team’s match at 20:00 hrs. See you then.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n        \n    \n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Interview: India men’s hockey coach Graham Reid on areas to improve, 3D skills, rotation & moreHere’s what coach Reid had told us:\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    In terms of what you saw in the Pro League matches at home earlier this year, did you identify maybe a couple of areas that you wanted to work on right away during this little camp? Was there something that caught your attention as the most important thing?I think penalty corners are always there, that’s just something you need to constantly work on. And we’ve been trying different ways to do things both in attack and defense. There’s only a certain amount of things you can do as far as the corners are concerned. So it’s a bit like Formula One racing – you spend a lot of time trying to improve on like 1% or half a percent.Goal shooting. We’re trying some different things in the attacking circle, getting a bit more focused around where we want to get the ball. You may have heard me talk about the Goal Opportunity Total or the GOT scores, which is basically a qualitative way of scoring your goal opportunities both for and against. One of the things we were noticing against Argentina and Spain was that we were creating a lot of ones and twos – in other words we’re getting into the circle but not really creating good enough opportunities. So we’re trying to focus on how we can turn those ones and twos into fours and fives. Five is basically almost a free shot in front of the goal. So to create fives is very difficult, but converting ones and twos into threes and fours should make it easier for us to score. So that’s the sort of stuff we’ve been working on.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Between the two teams, there were circle penetrations 56 times through the course of 60 minutes. That stat itself tells the story of a match played at high velocity from both teams. Belgium and India ended their match in a 3-3 draw, possibily the most fitting result between the two teams as there was nothing really to separate them. Shamsher Singh scored first for India, then Belgium scored three and the Olympic champions looked set to take home three points and move up to second place in the FIH Pro League table. Only for Harmanpreet Singh to score through a stroke, and Jarmanpreet to equalise in the 58th minute. Then it was Sreejesh’s save in the shootout that gave India the bonus point in Antwerp.The Indians will have to do much better tomorrow against the Belgians, if they want to catch up with the Dutch at the top of the leaderboard.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    Here's the list of players who had bad game today:End— Give Me Hockey (@hockeyind) June 11, 2022\n\n\n\n        \n    \n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    PR Sreejesh wins the player of the match in what has been a thrilling match. “Great comeback from my teammates.
