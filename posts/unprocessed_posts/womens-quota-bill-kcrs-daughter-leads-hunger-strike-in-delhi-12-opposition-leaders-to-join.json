{"title":"Women’s quota Bill: KCR’s daughter leads hunger strike in Delhi, 12 Opposition leaders to join","content":"Bharat Rashtra Samithi leader K Kavitha on Friday held a day-long hunger strike in Delhi, demanding passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill by Parliament. Kavitha, the daughter of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, held the demonstration a day before she is scheduled to appear before the Enforcement Directorate in connection with alleged irregularities in the Delhi government’s now-scrapped liquor policy.In a tweet on Friday, Kavitha noted that the Bill that seeks to reserve 33% seats for women in the Lok Sabha and all state Assemblies has been pending for last 27 years. “If India needs to develop, women should play a key role in politics,” she added.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had promised to implement the legislation in the run-up to the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections.“None of the BJP leaders [have] raised this issue and the Modi government has failed to get this Bill passed in Parliament despite having a majority,” Kavitha said. “This is a very saddening issue.”27 years later, Women’s Reservation Bill still continues to be absent from the Parliament. Together, we will ensure that 33% Women’s Reservation Bill is a reality.
