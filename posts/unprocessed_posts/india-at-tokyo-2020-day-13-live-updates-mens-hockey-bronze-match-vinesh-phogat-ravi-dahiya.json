{"title":"Tokyo 2020 day 13 as it happened: Ravi Kumar Dahiya bags silver, a famous bronze in men‚Äôs hockey ","content":"And that is it from us today. A historic bronze after 41 years for the men‚Äôs hockey to start off the day and then a silver for the brave Ravi Kumar Dahiya in wrestling. Golfer Aditi Ashok is tied in second place after two rounds. There were some close misses too ‚Äì for the 22-year-old Deepak Punia who was seconds away from securing a bronze. But the most sobering result of the day was watching Vinesh Phogat crash out early. The schedule for August 6 will be up on the site soon.

The number of opportunities at that time, we didn‚Äôt get that scoreboard pressure back on Belgium. There were a few periods of play when we lost the ball and they scored, and we spiralled a little bit after that. I think we paid the prize of not getting that scoreboard pressure back onto them when we could have.‚ÄúAs far as Germany is concerned, players are keen to make amends for yesterday (Tuesday), they are aware the Bronze medal is up for grabs.

There are certain days in sport that make you get up out of the bed in anticipation or dread or a weird combination of both. For hundreds of thousands of hockey fans in India, today has got to be one such. The wait has been long. After decades of dominating the Olympic Games, the Indian men‚Äôs team has gone decades without anything to celebrate apart from a match win here and there. Forty one years. Will that wait be over today? There is also the brilliant story of Vinesh Phogat to follow today, as she is on a redemption pathway not unlike Mirabai Chanu from Rio to Tokyo. Wrestling is where most of the action is going to be, assuming there are no early heartbreaks. We cannot wait.  \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    We are less than an hour away from the start of the #Hockey men's #Bronze medal game between India and Germany. #Tokyo2020Here is their head to head record at the #Olympics @TheHockeyIndia @DHB_hockey‚Äî International Hockey Federation (@FIH_Hockey) August 5, 2021\n\n\n\n        \n    \n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Stat tables and screenshots courtesy Tokyo 2020 official website.","author":"Ashish MagotraVinayakk Mohanarangan","time":"2021-08-05T06:25:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/162426-iavtoghavm-1628123918.jpeg","tags":["Tokyo 2020","Olympic Games","Vinesh Phogat","Ravi Dahiya","Men's hockey team"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1002072/india-at-tokyo-2020-day-13-live-updates-mens-hockey-bronze-match-vinesh-phogat-ravi-dahiya"}
