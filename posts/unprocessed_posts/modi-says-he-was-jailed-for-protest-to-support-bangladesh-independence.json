The Bangladeshi prime minister said that the two countries shares a “historical, social, cultural heritage and geographical rapport”, ANI reported. “The people and government of India were immensely involved the evolution process of Bangladesh during our liberation war in 1971,” she said. She added that India gave shelter to about one crore people who faced persecution by Pakistani soldiers. “India gave them shelter, food and medication,” she added. “They helped our freedom fighters with all types of cooperation.” On December 16, 1971, the chief of the Pakistani forces, General Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi, along with 93,000 troops, surrendered to the allied forces consisting of the Indian Army and the Mukti Bahini in Dhaka after their crushing defeat in the war.
