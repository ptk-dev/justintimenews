{"title":"Dadri lynching: Mohammed Akhlaq's son says Mathura lab report that said meat was beef was fabricated","content":"The son of Dadri lynching victim Mohammed Akhlaq, Sartaz Ahmad, said on Tuesday that the Mathura forensic report, which had claimed the meat found outside their house belonged to a cow or its progeny, was fabricated. Alleging a conspiracy, Ahmad also questioned how the sample size of the meat tested increased to 4 kg from the 2 kg tested for the initial report, which had found that the meat was mutton, not beef.Ahmad also alleged that the sample was tampered with, to save those who lynched Akhlaq, before it was sent to Mathura for testing, News18 reported. Akhlaq was beaten to death following rumours in Dadri that he and his family had consumed beef on Eid.The lawyers of the 17 accused in the case had made the Mathura lab report public to the media. A court had later ordered police to file an FIR against Akhlaq's family after villagers in Dadri demanded that a case of cow slaughter be lodged against them. However, authorities have maintained that the meat sample tested was taken from outside their house and Akhlaq's murder remains a heinous crime.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2016-07-26T16:39:23.001966+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/812516-article-hoseoejqnz-1446293382.jpg","tags":["Dadri lynching","Mohammed Akhlaq","Dadri"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/812516/dadri-lynching-mohammed-akhlaqs-son-says-mathura-lab-report-that-said-meat-was-beef-was-fabricated"}
