IOC Executive Board suspends Russian Olympic Committee with immediate effect.IOC statement: pic.twitter.com/vS7YoT1MLx— IOC MEDIA (@iocmedia) October 12, 2023\n\nAdams said the suspension had followed the unilateral decision taken by the Russian Olympic Committee on October 5 to include, as its members, the regional sports organisations which are under the authority of Ukraine’s NOC, namely Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia.That move, he added, “violates the territorial integrity of the NOC of Ukraine, as recognised by the International Olympic Committee in accordance with the Olympic Charter”.Adams added the IOC still reserved the right to decide about the participation of individual neutral athletes with a Russian passport at the 2024 Paris Games and 2026 Winter Games in Milan “at the appropriate time” in accordance with a policy adopted last year.The Russian Olympic Committee slammed the decision as “politically motivated”.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-10-12T19:55:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/194942-wtatfeflia-1697119560.jpg","tags":["Russian Olympic Committee","IOC","International Olympic Committee","Olympics"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1057518/russian-olympic-committee-suspended-by-ioc-executive-board"}
