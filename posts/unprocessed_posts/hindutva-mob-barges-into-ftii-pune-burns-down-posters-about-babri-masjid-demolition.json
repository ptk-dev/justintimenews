The student also accused the police of complicity, alleging that they watched students being attacked. The students have decided to address the issue legally and are presently holding a sit-in protest within the campus.The Babri mosque was demolished by Hindutva extremists on December 6, 1992, because they believed that it stood on the spot on which the deity Ram had been born. The incident had triggered communal riots across the country.In November 2019, the Supreme Court held that the demolition of the Babri mosque in 1992 was illegal but handed over the land to a trust for a Ram temple to be constructed. At the same time, it directed that a five-acre plot in Ayodhya be allotted to Muslims for a mosque to be constructed.On Monday, the Ram temple was inaugurated in a ceremony led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Also read:From the Babri demolition to the Ram Temple inauguration, a personal history of New IndiaHarsh Mander: Ayodhya dispute was not just about a plot of land – it was about how we imagine India","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-01-23T18:20:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/197774-lttuuvkmyv-1706012599.jpg","tags":["Babri mosque","Pune","Film and Television Institute of India","Ram temple"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1062593/hindutva-mob-barges-into-ftii-pune-burns-down-posters-about-babri-masjid-demolition"}
