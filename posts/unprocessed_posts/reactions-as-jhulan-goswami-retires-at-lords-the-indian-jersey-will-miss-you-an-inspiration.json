They remained unbeaten as well in the ICC Women’s Championship (points towards qualifying for the next ODI World Cup), with six wins out of six matches played.Goswami was given a guard of honour by the English player as she came out to bat. The 39-year-old then received another guard of honour as she came out to bowl, this one by her teammates and support staff.Once she stepped onto the field, she rolled back the years with the ball claiming the wickets of Alice Capsey and Kate Cross to finish with figures of 10-3-30-2 in her final match for India. She didn’t concede a run in the last two overs she bowled.Jhulan Goswami bows out: England vs India, 3rd ODI – Deepti Sharma seals 3-0 win with run outHere is how Twitter reacted to Goswami’s farewell:A LEGEND.

(with the last-pair defence ending with a run out backing up, riling up the locals.)Some farwells can be fairytale down to the end! #ENGvsIND— Zenia D'cunha (@ZENIADCUNHA) September 24, 2022\n\nTwo back to back 3-0 wins in ODIs for this Indian team. Won 4 of their final 5 games on this tour after that tepid start at Derby. Fitting finale for Jhulan.
