As per bail conditions, the senior RJD leader will have to submit his passport to the court and is not allowed to change his mobile number and residential address.Yadav has been in jail since December 2017 after being convicted in multiple cases related to the fodder scam that was exposed in 1996, involving the embezzlement of around Rs 1,000 crore from the state exchequer for the purchase of fictitious medicines and fodder for cattle. He was the chief minister of the state at the time.
