PM Modi laying the foundation of Ram Mandir is a historic and emotional day not only for me but all Indians.”Advani said that he felt humbled that destiny made him “perform a pivotal duty in the form of the Ram Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya in 1990”. He added that the movement had helped in rousing the passion among the numerous participants.The Ram Janmabhoomi movement mobilised support to build a temple at the spot where the 16th-century Babri Masjid stood before it was demolished in 1992 by BJP-led Hindutva groups.
