Special thanks to my physio, dietician, sports psychologist. They are who always motivated me.‚ÄùThe 34-year-old Patel‚Äôs impressive run at the Games ended with a 7-11 5-11 6-11 loss to Zhou, now a two-time singles gold medallist, in the women‚Äôs singles summit clash which lasted 19 minutes.Patel also lost to Zhou in her first group stage match earlier in the week. And those were the only two matches she lost, as she beat the world No 9, 8, 2 and 3 after that. Up against an opponent, who has five Paralympic medals to her name including gold medals in singles at Beijing and London, Patel wasn‚Äôt allowed the time and space to execute her strategy as Zhou went deep on the table to cramp her opponent. Much like the semifinal head-to-head, the Indian had not beaten Zhou in her career before and she will have to wait for that record to change. Patel, who was diagnosed with polio when she was 12 months old, had defeated world no 3 Miao Zhang of China 7-11 11-7 11-4 9-11 11-8 in the semifinal showdown on Saturday. In the quarterfinal on Friday, Patel had defeated 2016 Rio Paralympics gold medallist and world number two Borislava Peric Rankovic of Serbia to assure a medal and script history.Bhavina Patel and Sonal Patel are also in action in the women‚Äôs team event (Classes 4-5) later, with matches starting on August 31.With PTI inputs(With PTI inputs)","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2021-08-29T08:48:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/163364-nclvkatyqn-1630207120.jpeg","tags":["Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games","Tokyo Paralympics","Paralympics","Bhavina Patel","Table tennis"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1004013/tokyo-paralympics-table-tennis-bhavina-patel-wins-silver-first-indian-paddler-to-achieve-the-feat"}
