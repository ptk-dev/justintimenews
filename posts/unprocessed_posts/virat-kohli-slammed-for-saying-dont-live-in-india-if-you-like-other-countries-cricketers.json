{"title":"Virat Kohli says don’t live in India if you like other countries’ cricketers, slammed on Twitter","content":"India captain Virat Kohli has found himself in a bit of a sticky spot on Twitter after a video of him saying that Indians who don’t support the national cricket team should not live in the country. Kohli, who is on a brief break during the T20 series against West Indies, recorded the video as part of the promotions for his newly launched app, called the Virat Kohli Official App. It was released on his 30th birthday on Monday. In a section where he reacted to mean tweets sent to him, Kohli is seen replying to someone who said that they prefer English and Australian batsmen over him. Kohli replied saying that they should not live in India and asked them to get their priorities straight for “loving other countries”.He first read out the tweet that said: “Over-rated batsman and personally I see nothing special in his batting. I enjoy watching English and Australian batsmen more than these Indians.”In response, Kohli said, “Okay, I don’t think you should live in India then... you should go and live somewhere else no. Why are you living in our country and loving other countries? I don’t mind you not liking me but I don’t think you should live in our country and like other things. Get your priorities right.”Is #Kohli asking his non-Indian fans to leave their country and come to India🤔🤔.. Or to sort their priorities? #WTF pic.twitter.com/tRAX4QbuZI— H (@Hramblings) November 6, 2018\n\nWhile this may have been intended as a harmless response from the captain, his attitude has not gone down well with many on social media. Kohli was called unsporting by many for asking the person to leave India. I feel bad for a generation of Indian boys. Stick around for Harmanpreet kids. https://t.co/w0WElnKlZB— Rosie Roti (@supriyan) November 7, 2018\n\nIsn't Kohli a Federer fan? He should leave India for liking Federer over Yuki or Saketh or Ram. https://t.co/GZPn34uA1R— Mihir (@_buggywhip) November 7, 2018\n\nI have a new-found respect for Kohli now that I get a sense of the effort that goes into playing cricket under high pressure situations with the emotional maturity of a four year old.— Balu Raj 🍿 (@PorottaSambar) November 7, 2018\n\nThis is different form of 'Go to Pakistan' type message. https://t.co/nCLMhXTA9n— شمشیر (@shamshir_gaya) November 7, 2018\n\nMuch the same way people of Indian origin in Australia and England cheer for India whilst enjoying the perks of being citizens of those countries. What say @imVkohli ? Please ask all NRIs to support the baggy green on your tour to Australia next month https://t.co/ZPlLWmohc9— Asif (@asif737NG) November 7, 2018\n\nFFS! Everybody in India wants to be worshipped blindly. Virat Kohli wants Indian fans who don’t support him to move out of India. What else to expect from someone who regularly endorses Modi. pic.twitter.com/49AlEpItWo— Saif (@isaifpatel) November 7, 2018\n\nKohli's such a natural narrow-minded jock that this side of his comes through even in something that looks like a scripted PR moment https://t.co/5ACXHckWwV— Uday Bhatia (@yooday) November 7, 2018\n\nAsking a citizen to leave his own country is not up to you Virat. https://t.co/fGrEjYvQNU— Narayan (@thenarayan_) November 7, 2018\n\nYou can take a man out of Delhi but you can never take Delhi out of the man.This was long time coming, though. 😂😂 https://t.co/xArvZ9DMe3— Saniyan Nadal Fan (@kothubarotta) November 7, 2018\n\nsorting out my piorities today, guys! i'm leaving india to go america purely because i hate cricket 💅💫 https://t.co/rZtk525syu— mayonaise (@mayonistan) November 6, 2018\n\nHe's advanced & ultra-modern version of ‘ Border pe hamare jawan marr rhe hai aur tu Mohamed Amir ko like karta hai ’. https://t.co/WHPc06Fo4a— Raees Ahmed (@raeesahmed_) November 6, 2018\n\nI worry for Anushka. https://t.co/nSbNOqBOQ6— Rahul Desai (@ReelReptile) November 7, 2018\n\nWhy did you get married in Italy?
