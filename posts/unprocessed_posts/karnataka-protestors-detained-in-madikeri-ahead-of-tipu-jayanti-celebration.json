G Parameshwara, who was to replace Kumaraswamy, also gave the celebrations a miss, PTI reported.“While Cong-JD(S) government is celebrating a tyrant Tipu, the CM himself goes into hiding, what is the point of celebrating a fanatic when CM himself abandons a government function,” BJP Karnataka tweeted. “Glorifying a mass murderer just for vote bank clearly shows mindset of this government.”Congress MLA Tanveer Sait claimed that Kumaraswamy and Parameshwara’s absence from the celebrations “seems like an insult to the [Muslim] community”, ANI reported. “There is no doubt about it,” he added.
