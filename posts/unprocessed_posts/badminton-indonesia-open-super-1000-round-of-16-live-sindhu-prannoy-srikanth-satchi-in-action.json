{"title":"Indonesia Open Super 1000, R16 blog: Satwik-Chirag, Prannoy, Srikanth win; Sindhu, Priyanshu bow out","content":"06.30 pm: So here is a quick preview of the quarterfinal matchups. Join us for the blog tomorrow.Srikanth vs Li Shi Feng: The former champion at the Indonesia Open takes on the reigning All England champion. Srikanth has won their only past meeting, in the round of 32 on his way to silver at the 2021 World Championships. Li will perhaps start the favourite here.HS Prannoy vs Kodai Naraoka: One of the tougher nuts to crack in world badminton at the moment, Naraoka will come into this match with a 4-0 H2H against Prannoy. They had met in the first round last week in Singapore and it was a hard-fought contest for 56 minutes even though Naraoka won in straight games.Satwik-Chirag vs Alfian-Ardianto: Perhaps the match of the day in men’s doubles. The top seeds from Indonesia who will have the entire Istora behind them vs one of the hottest pairs in world at the moment in SatChi. The H2H is 2-1 in favour of Indonesians, but they haven’t met since Thailand Open in 2019 and since then a lot has changed for both pairs.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    India’s matches in the round of 16: Srikanth Kidambi 21-17 22-20 Lakshya Sen (Srikanth will face Li Shi Feng next)PV Sindhu 18-21 16-21 Tai Tzu Ying  (Court 1)HS Prannoy 21-18, 21-16 Ng Ka Long Angus (Prannoy faces Naraoka next)Priyanshu Rajawat 22-20, 15-21, 15-21 Anthony GintingSatwik-Chirag 21-17, 21-15 He-Zhou (Chirag-Satwik to face top seeds Alfian/Ardianto next)\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Reaction from Priyanshu Rajawat after the defeat against Anthony Ginting:“It’s a great experience for me. It was overwhelming, because after winning the first game I felt I had a chance, but I made too many mistakes under pressure. I’ll take a lot of confidence from this match, I hope I can maintain this level.”Reaction from Ginting:“It was a tough match, maybe because it’s our first meeting. I only saw him play on YouTube.“I had a lead in the first game, but he changed the way he played, and I don’t know what happened. I tried to get back by changing my tactics, tried to push him by playing aggressively, but not to rush. He’s got a good defence as well, it’s not easy to get a point from him, so I had to play patiently.“He could be a player to watch.
