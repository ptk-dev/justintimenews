And within a minute of coming on, Rohit gets booked. Alenezi harries him from behind for the ball and Rohit responds by shoving him away.

The free-kick flies high above the goal. GSS spots Chhetri‚Äôs run and takes his goalkick quickly. Mohammad Abdullah also spots Chhetri‚Äôs and does what Ashique did moments ago and gets booked as well.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    61‚Äô, IND 1-1 KUW: Poor clearance from Marzouq.

Alfaneeni and Alqallaf mess up clearing a ball allowing Thapa to try and get to it. Alfaneeni brings him down only for the referee to book Alqallaf. Alfaneeni tells the referee that he made the foul but to no avail.

The Indian skipper was jostling for the ball with Alharbi and was ushered off it by the Kuwaiti. The assistant flags for a foul against Chhetri who is angry and tells him that his shirt was being pulled. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    48‚Äô, IND 1-1 KUW: Chhetri furious at Sahal after he loses possession to end a promising Indian attack.

Jhingan and Chhetri descend upon referee Prajwol Chetri to demand a booking. The referee obliges and books Albloushi. That angers Aldhefeery who confronts the referee and sees himself get booked.
