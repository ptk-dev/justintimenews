{"title":"Australian Open, mixed doubles final blog: Brazilians win title, Sania Mirza bows out of big stage","content":"09.00 am: And thus ends a memorable Grand Slam career for Sania Mirza. Not with the winners trophy, but a second-placed finish and a fair few reminders that her forehand is still deadly and can continue being so if she wished. The retirement will happen within a few weeks in Dubai but for all intents and purposes, this is the big farewell. That it happened at the Rod Laver Arena after a final, in front of her son as she reminded at the end, is in itself special. Australian Open will always hold a special place in her career. A match against Serena, being seeded in the singles main draw, her first Major final (mixed doubles 2008), her first Major win (mixed doubles 2009)... and her final Major match (mixed doubles 2023). Thanks for the memories, Sania. It was a privilege. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    Over 22-year career, #SaniaMirza trailblazed her way to the top, forging a path laden with 6 Grand Slams and 44 tour titles. She did this when there was nobody else to follow. But for the ones coming up, they have Sania Mirza.https://t.co/MBnGbPnhTd pic.twitter.com/Fg01tI5TpJ— Shahid Judge (@shahidthejudge) January 27, 2023\n\n\n\n    Sania Mirza: \"If I cry, these are happy tears.\"\"I'm still going to play a couple more tournaments but my career started in Melbourne in 2005 when I played  Serena as an 18yo.

But Matos holds serve as Bopanna misses at the net on the deciding point.(Reminder: No advantage-deuce in mixed doubles these days, the point at 40-40 decides the game)\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Mixed doubles final, Mirza-Bopanna 3-2 Stefani-Matos: And a good service game it is.

The Indians need to apply pressure here. Bopanna misses a volley winner at the start that he’d normally put away. But a window opens at 15-30. Super ace then from the Brazilian, ace to Bopanna. 30-30. A lucky net cord for the Indians via Mirza and break point.

It is time for India vs Brazil, Sania Mirza-Rohan Bopanna versus Luisa Stefani-Rafael Matos. It’s been quite the journey for the Indian stalwart. And it is brilliant for the romantics in all of us that her final match at a Grand Slam is a final at Australia Open, the Major where she made her singles breakthrough and the Major where she won her first title back in 2009 with Mahesh Bhupathi. “The greatest memory that I will carry with me for a life time is that of the pride and happiness that I saw on the faces of my fellow countrymen and supporters each time I achieved victory and reached milestones in my long career,” she wrote recently.And today, there is a chance for one more. One final celebration perhaps, but that is true irrespective of the result. We can’t wait to get started.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Screenshots in the blog: Sony LIV / Australian Open match centre","author":"Vinayakk Mohanarangan","time":"2023-01-27T06:39:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/186130-hjvynrlurx-1674785991.jpg","tags":["Australia Open","Aus Open 2023","Australia Open 2023","Sania Mirza-Rohan Bopanna","Luisa Stefani-Rafael Matos"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1042666/australian-open-mixed-doubles-final-live-sania-mirza-rohan-bopanna-vs-luisa-stefani-rafael-matos"}
