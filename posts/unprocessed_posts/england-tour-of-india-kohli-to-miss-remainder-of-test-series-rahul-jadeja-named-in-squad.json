According to Cricinfo, the batter experienced some back spams post the second Test, but was cleared for selection.In the press release naming the 17-member squad for the latter half of the series, KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja, sat out the second Test in Vishakapatnam due to injury – Jadeja with a hamstring injury and Rahul with a right quadriceps pain.In their place, Sarfaraz Khan, Sourabh Kumar and Washington Sundar were all named as replacements, but only Khan and Washington have been named in the squad for the Tests in Rajkot, Ranchi and Dharamsala. Other than these two, Rajat Patidar, who made his debut in Vishakapatnam, also retains his spot.It is a first Test squad call-up for fast bowler Akash Deep, who impressed during the red-ball series against England Lions, where he picked up 11 wickets across the three matches.The inclusion of Rahul and Jadeja is also contingent on them being declared medically fit by the BCCI team ahead of the Tests.The series is currently 1-1, with England having won the first Test in Hyderabad by 28 runs before India struck back with a 106-run victory in Vishakapatnam to level the series. The third Test begins in Rajkot on February 15, followed by Ranchi on February 23 and ends in Dharamsala with the final Test starting on March 7.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-02-10T12:08:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/187845-jbixoczxif-1678603026.jpg","tags":["Virat Kohli","KL Rahul","England tour of India","Cricket","Ravindra Jadeja","India","England"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1063493/england-tour-of-india-kohli-to-miss-remainder-of-test-series-rahul-jadeja-named-in-squad"}
