But the young left-handed duo of Tilak Varma and Nehal Wadhera steadied the ship for the visitors.Varma played more of an anchor role, scoring 65 off 45, while Wadhera went after the bowlers, striking at a rate of 204.17. Together the duo stitched a 99-run partnership in nine overs.Wadhera’s wicket however – he was dismissed for 49 off 24 deliveries – effectively stopped the scoring.Pandya scored a run-a-ball 10, and Tim David managed just three before the tailenders were brought in to bat.Since Wadhera’s wicket to the end of the innings, Mumbai managed to score only 28 runs from 23 deliveries.The Field’s player of the matchThere were really only two options for this one.Jaiswal has struggled for runs so far this season – his best before Monday this term was 39 against the Punjab Kings. He put in an impressive performance with the bat to score his first ton this season, remaining unbeaten on 104.However, Sandeep Sharma’s fabulous display with the ball eclipsed all others. In a tournament where conditions, pitches, and short boundaries are favouring batters, Sharma picked up five wickets for just 18 runs in his four overs – the best figures this season.And he came up with this performance in his first match since returning to the squad after an injury that saw him miss five games for his team.On Monday, he picked up the important wickets of Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav before dismissing Varma, David and Gerald Coetzee.#IPL2024 #RRvsMIFrom being down 52/4, Mumbai Indians were rescued by the efforts of Tilak Varma and Nehal Wadhera to eventually reach a fighting 179/9.Sandeep Sharma, in his third match this season, was the pick of the bowlers with figures of 5/18.📷 AFP / Jio Cinema… pic.twitter.com/LIn4cpqmkI— The Field (@thefield_in) April 22, 2024\n\n\n‘Have to have a big heart’Sharma was declared fit by his team just two days prior to the match. And he made good on his much-awaited return to the team with an impressive five-for.“If you’re bowling in the end, you have to have a big heart. We’ve seen it in this IPL that the bowlers are under the pump and going big. It’s important to have a big heart and keep trying to have variations and a plan. That’s what I’m trying to do.“Two years back I went unsold and came in as a replacement. So, any game that I’m playing I’m taking as a bonus and enjoying myself.”Points table after the Rajasthan Royals vs Mumbai Indians match | Courtesy: Jio Cinema","author":"Shahid Judge","time":"2024-04-23T00:49:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/200234-tykpmohbqx-1713813508.jpg","tags":["Sandeep Sharma","Yashasvi Jaiswal","Rajasthan Royals","Mumbai Indians","Hardik Pandya","IPL 2024","Indian Premier League","Cricket","IPL"]}
