In the video, you can very well appreciate that they are following queue and trying to be orderly. The migrant labourer is doing their best to co-operate in this crisis responsibly.

After the UP government arranged for nearly 1,200 special buses for workers who were walking back home on foot, thousands of labourers arrived at the Anand Vihar bus station.A stampede-like situation reportedly rose at some points at the bus station, with the police hitting people with their batons and making announcements on loudspeakers in an attempt to control the crowd.
