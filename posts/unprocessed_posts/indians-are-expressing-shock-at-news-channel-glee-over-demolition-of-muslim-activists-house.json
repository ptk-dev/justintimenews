{"title":"Indians are expressing shock at news channel glee over demolition of Muslim activist‚Äôs house","content":"On Sunday, as the Prayagraj Development Authority demolished the house of activist Javed Mohammed in Prayagraj on Friday, accusing him of organising protests, social media users expressed shock over how many media organisations cheered on the action.Several news channels freely referred to Javed as the ‚Äúmastermind‚Äù behind the protests in Prayagraj, imputed guilt based on the documents found at his residence and portrayed the demolition as another strong signal by the Adityanath government when it comes to law and order.Protests were held in several parts of India on Friday against controversial remarks on Prophet Mohammad made by former BJP leaders Nupur Sharm and Naveen Jindal. The houses of at least three Muslim leaders, who were allegedly involved with the protests, have been demolished by the Uttar Pradesh government.Earlier also, when demolitions were carried out in Jahangipuri in New Delhi in April, several media houses had cheered these drives.‚ÄòCelebrating demolition of muslim houses‚ÄôMany sections of the media portrayed this demolitions as the Uttar Pradesh government sending a message to ‚Äúrioters‚Äù. During a live broadcast of the demolition, a reporter from ABP News said, ‚Äú Ye karwaai nai ye sandesh hai dangaaiyoon ke liye. Ye UP hai‚Ä¶‚Äù This is not a proceeding but a message to rioters. This is Uttar Pradesh.The reporter continued: ‚ÄúParson danga hua aur 48 ghante nai beete ki ghar pe diwar aur gate girne shuru ho gaye hai. Makan giraya jayga aur bataya jayega ki danga karne walon ka Uttar Pradesh mein kya hashr hota hai.‚Äù A day before there was a riot and within 48 hours the walls and gate have started falling. The house will be brought down and it will be shown what happens to rioters in UP.He added that now no one will have the courage to do similar things.

Aaj Tak ran headlines such as ‚ÄúYogi sakth.  Pathharbaziyon pe action zabardast!‚Äù Yogi is tough. Impressive  action on stone pelters! \n\n\n    \n    Play\n\nEven CNN News 18 carried triumphant headlines during its coverage. The channel flashed messages such as ‚ÄúAction they won‚Äôt forget‚Äù and ‚Äú‚ÄòMastermind‚Äô made to pay‚Äù. This trimphalist tone for an action many experts have termed illegal drew wide criticism. A number of users on social media pointed out that such coverage was hate-filled. Hello @CNN,Your partner in india is merrily celebrating the state-sponsored demolition of muslim houses as some sort of perverted sense of justice.These demolitions are illegal and unconstitutional.

A reporter for CNN News 18 repeatedly bought up a poster retrieved from Javed‚Äôs house, which read, ‚Äúwhen injustice becomes law, rebellion becomes duty‚Äù. ‚ÄúIss poster mein bahut kahani chippi hui hai,‚Äù he said. This poster has a number of stories hidden behind it.#BREAKING | #UttarPradeshViolence | #PrayagrajViolence | Several flags and posters are collected from Javed Mohammed's house.

Many pointed out that this slogan had been used by other politicians also earlier, without drawing any such criticism.Several TV channels are showing that they found posters with a quote, \"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty\" from accused Javed Md's house in Prayagraj.

However, several users flagged this, given that it has not been proved yet that Javed was the mastermind behind the protests in Lucknow or, in fact, that he had any had in organising them. For instance, the ABP News flashed headlines saying, ‚ÄúJaved ‚ÄòPump‚Äô [his nickname] is the mastermind behind Prayagraj violence.‚Äù Even AajTak, in certain instances, referred to Javed as the mastermind of the operation.The ABP News headline reads: \"Javed Pump is the mastermind behind Prayagraj violence\".

The editor in chiefs, news reporter of print and anchors of electronic media are having sadistic pleasure on demolition of houses of Muslims. They are gaga on the arrival of fascism in India. History shall be cruel to these lumpen lunatics.‚Äî Dr Vijendra Singh (@singhthakurvije) June 13, 2022\n\nYou know what's scary? Not the bulldozing, but the celebration of the act everywhere on social media.Shock from a few, hoorahs from the rest. What do you do when your own fellow citizens are craving for vigilante justice?‚Äî Joe (@josephradhik) June 13, 2022\n\nThe celebrations around the demolition of Muslim houses by the media and the people in general are an exhibit of blind hate.This is exactly how a lawless land with a morally dead, socially corrupt and mentally radicalized society looks like. Exactly like this.‚Äî Saniya Sayed (@Ssaniya_) June 12, 2022\n\nThose celebrating the demolition forget that without proper process and legal recourse we all live at the mercy of the state. They will come for you some day. And you will not have anybody left to stand by you. They will have silenced them all‚Äî Roshan Abbas (@roshanabbas) June 13, 2022\n\nRepeat from the pastJournalists have drawn attention to how when similar instances of ‚Äúbulldozer justice‚Äù took place, several sections of the media lauded the government for such action.
