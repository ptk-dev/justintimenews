Of these, at least 41,770 Indians had illegally crossed into the US through the country’s southern land border with Mexico. The figure has more than doubled from the same period last year. More than 83,500 of the illegal migrants from India were single adults, while 12,409 were individuals in a family. There were 730 unaccompanied children or minors as well.  Nearly all Indians illegally entering the US turn themselves into the Border Patrol to avoid getting arrested. This is so that they can apply for asylum in the US, The Wall Street Journal had reported in October.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-12-26T10:43:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/196945-zpxznuwaog-1703565448.jpg","tags":["human trafficking","India","France"]}
