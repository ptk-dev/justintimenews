However, on the same afternoon, Gangopadhyay allowed the documents of the case to be handed over to the central law enforcement agency.On January 25, Gangopadhyay passed another directive stating that the division bench’s stay order should be ignored, even though legal precedent requires a single-judge bench to comply with the orders of a larger bench.Gangopadhyay also accused Sen of being an “interested party” in the case.On January 29, the Supreme Court transferred to itself all proceedings related to the matter.Gangopadhyay was appointed as an additional judge in the Calcutta High Court in 2018 and was made a permanent judge in 2020.In the past two years, he has ordered investigations by central agencies into several cases of alleged irregularities in the job recruitment process of the state education department as well as in the recruitment processes of civic bodies.Also read: Why a Calcutta High Court judge joining BJP has raised questions about judicial independence","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-07T14:59:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/198863-hisqxcsxtc-1709185498.jpg","tags":["Abhijit Gangopadhyay","Calcutta High Court","BJP"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1064871/west-bengal-abhijit-gangopadhyay-joins-bjp-two-days-after-resigning-as-calcutta-high-court-judge"}
