{"title":"Sushil Kumar moves Delhi High Court seeking trials against Narsingh Yadav for Rio Olympics berth","content":"Two-time Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar moved the Delhi High Court on Monday seeking the organisation of trials against fellow wrestler Narsingh Yadav for a berth in the Rio Olympics. The hearing is likely to take place on Tuesday. Yadav had secured India's quota berth for the 74 kg category during last year's Wrestling World Championships in Las Vegas. Kumar could not participate in the tournament because of an injured shoulder and had asked the Wrestling Federation of India to hold national trials to decide who goes to Rio de Janeiro. Kumar, who won medals for India in the 2008 and 2012 Games, has also appealed to the Prime Minister's Office, the Sports Ministry, the Indian Olympic Association and fans to support the trials.Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Monday said the central government will not intervene in the selection battle. Sonowal added that only the WFI can decide who will represent the country in the Summer Olympics this August, reported PTI. The WFI had asked the Sports Ministry to intervene in the matter. The Federation fears that if it holds trials, wrestlers from other weight categories will also demand the same. However, Sonowal told PTI, \"Government has nothing to do with it. The Federation, which is an autonomous body, is the final authority. We stood by the national sports code and respect the autonomy of all sports Federations.\"","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2016-05-16T15:07:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/808214-zayhqcxaks-1463394447.jpg","tags":["rio olympics","sushil kumar","narsingh yadav","wrestling"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/808214/centre-will-not-intervene-in-narsingh-yadav-sushil-kumar-selection-battle-says-sports-minister"}
