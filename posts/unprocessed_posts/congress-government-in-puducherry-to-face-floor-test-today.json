The Congress government in Puducherry was reduced to a minority, following the resignation of four of its MLAs. Congress legislator A John Kumar resigned last Tuesday, following Malladi Krishna Rao who quit on Monday. Two others, A Namassivayam and E Theeppainjan, had resigned in January.A day before the government’s test of strength, two more MLAs – one from the Congress and the other from the DMK – tendered their resignations. K Lakshminarayanan, the Congress MLA, said he quit because he did not get his due recognition in the party. The MLA said he had been approached by the Bharatiya Janata Party and the regional NR Congress. He added that he will make his next move after consulting his supporters.After all these resignations, the number of MLAs supporting the Puducherry government in the Assembly had been reduced to 12, including the Speaker.

The simple majority mark was 14.Soundararajan had ordered the floor test for the Congress government on Thursday. She was given the additional charge of Puducherry on Tuesday after the Centre removed Kiran Bedi from the lieutenant governor’s position.Political reactionsRajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot termed the political development in Puducherry as “most unfortunate” and a case of BJP “ destabilising Congress governments to grab power through unethical means”. He cited similar happenings in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.What has happened in #Puducherry is most unfortunate & yet another case of how BJP is destabilising Congress govts to grab power through unethical means. First, they created problems in running the administration through the Lieutenant Governor and now this has happened.1/3— Ashok Gehlot (@ashokgehlot51) February 22, 2021\n\nLuring Congress MLAs has been their modus operandi in all Congress ruled states. We saw this in Karnataka, MP & now in #Puducherry. They tried it in Rajasthan but people of Rajasthan taught them a lesson.2/3— Ashok Gehlot (@ashokgehlot51) February 22, 2021\n\nOn the other hand, BJP’s Information Technology cell head Amit Malviya mocked Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, suggesting that the party lost power due to his “midas touch”.Rahul Gandhi went to Puducherry and true to his midas touch, Congress loses its government in the UT!— Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya) February 22, 2021\n\n“It’s just a matter of time before Rahul Gandhi achieves, which no other Gandhi has...,” he said, in another tweet, pointing out that the Congress had governments in only three states.After Congress lost its government in Puducherry, its presence has shrunk to just 3 states - Punjab, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh. In Jharkhand and Maharashtra, it is as good as on the margin.It’s just a matter of time before Rahul Gandhi achieves, which no other Gandhi has...— Amit Malviya (@amitmalviya) February 22, 2021","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2021-02-22T10:01:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/155266-piakhbpglf-1613983804.jpg","tags":["V Narayanasamy","floor test","Puducherry"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/987553/congress-government-in-puducherry-to-face-floor-test-today"}
