{"title":"Songs for the New Year: In times of gau raksha, a Baul-rock melody by Lalon Fakir","content":"Khachar Bhitor Ochin PakhiPerformed by Sumon \n\n\n    \n    Play\n\nKhachar Bhitor Ochin Pakhi is a popular Baul song by Lalon Shah (also known as Lalon Fakir), whose followers include both Hindus and Muslims. His humanitarian songs are still sung by followers of different devotional traditions. Lalon died on October 17, 1890. He is believed to have been 116 at the time. Every year, a three-day Baul festival is organised in Lalon’s shrine at Chheuriya in Kushtia district in Bangladesh’s Khulna division. It is believed to have started from his very first death anniversary. This Baul-rock composition was edited and directed in 2015 by Bangladeshi bassist named Sumon (popular as Bassbaba Sumon), roping in performers from some of his country’s best-known bands. The lyrics, translated by my colleague Arunava Sinha, say:The unknown bird is in the cageHow will it fly awayIf I could catch it I’d put shackles on its feetWith my heartHow will it fly awayYou’re longing for the cage, my heartYour cage is those fragile bamboo shootsAny day now the cage will crumbleSays Fakir Lalon, weepingIn the turbulent times of gau raksha, this is a sentiment that keeps me going. There is no better song with which I could start my new year.","author":"Abhishek Dey","time":"2018-01-01T18:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/863365-77891-suaamumoku-1514721307.jpg","tags":["High Notes 2018","Lalon Shah","Sumon"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/863365/songs-for-the-new-year-in-times-of-gau-raksha-a-baul-rock-melody-by-lalon-fakir"}
