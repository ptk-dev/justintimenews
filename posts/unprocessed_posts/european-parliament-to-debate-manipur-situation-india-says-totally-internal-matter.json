{"title":"European Parliament to debate Manipur situation, India says ‘totally internal’ matter","content":"Hours before the members of the European Parliament were to hold a debate on the ethnic violence in Manipur, India on Wednesday said that the matter was an internal one.“This is a matter totally internal to India...We have conveyed this to European parliamentarians as well,” Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra said.Manipur has been witnessing ethnic clashes between the Kuki and Meitei communities since May 3. Widespread incidents of violence and arson continue to deepen the crisis in the state. Over 140 people have been killed and nearly 60,000 have been forced to flee their homes.Opposition parties have criticised the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led governments in the Centre and in Manipur for not doing enough to stop the violence in the states.
