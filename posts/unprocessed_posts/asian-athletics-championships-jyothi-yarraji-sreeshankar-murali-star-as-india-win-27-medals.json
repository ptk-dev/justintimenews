So, I thought it was a winning jump. But unfortunately, we fell very short.”Sreeshankar could have won gold but was beaten to it by Chinese Taipei’s Yu-Tang Lin who posted a best jump of 8.40m to add the Asian Championships title to the Asian Indoor Championships gold he won in February this year.“It was a really good competition,” Sreeshankar said. “And all my previous jumps, I was taking off much behind the board, like just only touching the board in a few of the jumps. So, I knew that today would be a good day for jumping because the weather was similar to Bhubaneswar.”Having won silver in the 60m hurdles at the indoor championships, Yarraji upgraded her medal to gold in the 100m hurdles with a time of 13.0s, just 0.26s short of her personal best.
