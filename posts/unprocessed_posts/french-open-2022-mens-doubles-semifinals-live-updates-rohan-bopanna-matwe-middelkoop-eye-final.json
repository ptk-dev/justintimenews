Stats: In a match with just one break of serve for each pair... Arevalo/Rojer prevail 10-8 in the end... such fine margins!

They came to within two points of the final. Jean-Julien Rojer and Marcelo Arevalo take the win 10-8 in the Super tiebreaker. Great tournament nevertheless. #RolandGarros‚Äî PP (@PrashantSport) June 2, 2022\n\n\n\n    That overhead miss by Bopanna at the start of the super tiebreak will sting for a while. Nonetheless, the 42-year-old can be proud of his performance this tournament.
