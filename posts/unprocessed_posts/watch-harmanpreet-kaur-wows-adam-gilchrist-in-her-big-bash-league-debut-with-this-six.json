{"title":"Watch: Harmanpreet Kaur wows Adam Gilchrist in her Big Bash League debut with this six","content":"After Emma Inglis of Melbourne Stars smashed one on the roof of the North Sydney Oval, India’s Harmanpreet Kaur would go on to display exquisite technique and timing later in the game despite the Sydney Thunder going down by six runs.India’s Twenty20 skipper, earlier, became the first player from her country to play in the Big Bash League. Kaur got off to a memorable start despite her team going down by a narrow margin of six runs.Kaur’s flashy strokeplay was in full flow as she tried her best to help Thunder chase down the target. One shot in particular, was a standout: The 26-year-old chipped a full length delivery from left-armer Gemma Triscari, and the ball landed over the ropes. The bowler was amused, probably bewildered by what she just saw. Importantly, Australia legend Adam Gilchrist was mighty impressed sitting in the commentary box, exclaiming, “That’s as good a cricket shot you are going to get to see!”","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2016-12-11T11:24:36.925842+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/823856-47154-jwcbzlnbvx-1481435472.jpg","tags":["Cricket","Harmanpreet Kaur","Adam Gilchrist","Sydney Thunder"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/823856/watch-harmanpreet-kaur-wows-adam-gilchrist-in-her-big-bash-league-debut-with-this-six"}
