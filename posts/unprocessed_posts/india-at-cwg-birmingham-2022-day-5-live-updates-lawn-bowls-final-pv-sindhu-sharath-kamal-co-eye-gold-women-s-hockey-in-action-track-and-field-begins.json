And then at the end of a round, a point is awarded to the player or team whose bowl is closest to the jack. And in case a team has more than one bowl closer to the jack than their opponents, the corresponding number of points will be awarded for the end.‚Äî Scroll.in \n\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n     Women's 76kg starting weights (could change) \n    \n       CGA  Name  Snatch (kg)  Clean & Jerk (kg)  Total start weight \n    \n     CAN  Maya LAYLOR  95  120  215  IND  Punam YADAV  95  116  211  NRU  Maximina UEPA  90  115  205  NGR  Taiwo LIADI  90  110  200  ENG  Deborah ALAWODE  88  111  199  AUS  Ebony GORINCU  87  110  197  CMR  Jeanne Gaelle EYENGA MBOOSI  85  110  195  SCO  Agata HERBERT  86  105  191  WAL  Amy SALT  70  105  175  JAM  Chloe Rebecca WHYLIE  75  93  168  BAN  Monira KAZI  70  90  160 \n  \n\n    Vijay Kumar Yadav clinched #TeamIndia's second medal in judo at @birminghamcg22 ü•ãüëèüí™He wrapped up his match in under a minute ‚è≤Ô∏è and won ü•â  in the men's 60kg category üôå#EkIndiaTeamIndia | #B2022 | #CWG2022 pic.twitter.com/p9SPQLpFAs‚Äî Team India (@WeAreTeamIndia) August 2, 2022\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Lawn bowls: The women‚Äôs triples team is leading in its Section C first round match against New Zealand at the moemnt, while the women‚Äôs pairs team is trailing against NZ in its Section B first round match.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n\n    #CWG2022 #B2022#Swimming üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 100m backstroke final: 7th50m backstroke final: 5th@srihari3529 has had a fine, fine Commonwealth Games campaign so far.
