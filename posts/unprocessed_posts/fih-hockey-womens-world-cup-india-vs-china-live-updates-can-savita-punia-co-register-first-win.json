A come-from-behind win for Black Sticks as they produced a clinical display, and finally added a W to the column in Pool B. Huge frustrations for England (look at the stats!) Much like India, they were just unable to convert chances, esp PCs. Brilliant from New Zealand, took their chances.

The two teams have faced each other three times this year, with India winning all three matches. India registered a 2-0 win in the bronze medal playoff at the Asia Cup and won both the FIH Hockey Pro League Matches (7-1 and 2-1). Under legendary coach Alyson Annan now, however, this will a tough test. India are aware of that too. A key aspect of today‚Äôs match will be PCs. China are brilliant from set-pieces, while India conceded 0 PCs against England. The match could well be determined by who wins more PCs / converts them today.  \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    India's line-up as they gear up to face China today, 5th July in the FIH Hockey Women's World Cup Spain and Netherlands 2022!Catch the action üèë LIVE at 8:00 PM (IST) exclusively on Star Sports First, Star Sports 3, and Disney+Hotstar. üì∫ pic.twitter.com/gOSkY01BdF‚Äî Hockey India (@TheHockeyIndia) July 5, 2022\n\n\n\n    Next match against China #bharatkisherniya @TheHockeyIndia #WorldCup2022 pic.twitter.com/v56r4XB61n‚Äî Sjoerd Marijne (@SjoerdMarijne) July 5, 2022\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Hello and welcome to Scroll.in‚Äôs coverage of India‚Äôs second match at the FIH Women‚Äôs World Cup, against China.The Indians put up a decent show against England in their opening match, holding the European side to a 1-1 draw.
