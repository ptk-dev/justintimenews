{"title":"The Art of Resistance: Ringing in the new year with CAA protesters at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh","content":"Most New Year celebrations feature revelry, a countdown and fireworks. At Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, where protesters against the new Citizenship Amendment Act  have occupied a main road for more than two weeks, 2020 began with the national anthem. And in a scene that will give you goosebumps, here's the crowd at #ShaheenBagh singing the national anthem to ring in #NewYear2020 .#CAA_NRC_Protest pic.twitter.com/YjS30fmQDE— Vakasha Sachdev (@VakashaS) December 31, 2019\n\nShaheen Bagh rings in the New Year with the national anthem. pic.twitter.com/CwbeLbdnrB— Rohan Venkat (@RohanV) December 31, 2019\n\nDespite the freezing temperatures – this is coldest winter Delhi has ever  recorded – and threat of police action at any time, hundreds gathered to  wave the national flag and speak up against a set of government moves that they believe will undo the Indian Constitution’s commitment to secularism. The protesters believe that the Citizenship Act amendments, and the National Register of Citizens promised by Home Minister Amit Shah, will be used as tools to harass Indian Muslims, even though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has insisted that these policies will not harm anyone.“Modi is sleeping. I want to wake him up,” said Dawood, a student from Jamia Milia Islamia, the university where police brutality against protesting students inspired first campuses and then people from around the country to come out in solidarity. “He needs to know that people will not stand for this. So I’m collecting messages for him.” Nearby a pair of young boys was writing one such message that Dawood says will be delivered to the Prime Minister’s Office: Modi, the spirit of revolution will fall out of the sky upon your head.  Shaheen Bagh in many ways typifies the protest movement that has erupted around the country in opposition to the Citizenship Act. It is leaderless. No political party or organisation can claim to be leading of the protest. Instead, it is fueled primarily by the residents of the Muslim-dominated neighbourhood who fear that the government’s moves will threaten their status as citizens. It is also features women at the forefront.

Not on anyone’s orders.”On New Year’s eve, the protest was actually a combination of many demonstrations. Up front, in the tented area, a parade of speakers – Dr Kafeel Khan, Harsh Mander, Yogendra Yadav – praised the tenacity of the Shaheen Bagh’s residents and their determination to sit through the cold, pressure from the police and fear for their lives. One poet, after a long satirical poem about journalists (“TV channel or newspaper, we are all here to peddle lies, I am a journalist, only money is my God”) led the crowd in chants of “Hindu-Muslim unity”, a pointed response to those who have sought to portray the protests as the work of radical Islamic elements. \"Hindu-Muslim ekta, zindabadInquilab, zindabad.\" pic.twitter.com/RxI7Uu459G— Rohan Venkat (@RohanV) December 31, 2019\n\nBut beyond the tent, people filled up the road, toting placards or huddled around little bonfires, all calling for the Citizenship Act to be repealed. “I might have been with my friends if this was a normal New Year’s,” said one young woman from Shaheen Bagh who didn’t want to be identified. “But this is not a normal New Year’s.”","author":"Rohan Venkataramakrishnan","time":"2020-01-01T10:41:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/133852-qlwjzdtgei-1577854372.jpg","tags":["The Art of Resistance","Shaheen Bagh","Citizenship Act","National Register of Citizens"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/948440/the-art-of-resistance-ringing-in-the-new-year-with-anti-caa-protesters-at-shaheen-bagh"}
