{"title":"Citizenship Act protests: Two dead in Mangaluru, one in Lucknow; thousands detained across India","content":"11 pm: Historian Ramchandra Guha, who was detained in Bengaluru earlier in the day, tells NDTV that the enforcement of Section 144 in the city is the mark of a “paranoid, fearful and insecure” regime. “The British viceroy did the same thing. [Former Prime Minister] Indira Gandhi did the same thing,” he says. “The police thought if they pick up 15 people in Bengaluru they would be scared. There was absolutely no reason to impose Section 144 unless you are plain stupid.”\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    10.50 pm: “We have detained around 32 people, we are registering first information report,” says Ahmedabad Commissioner of Police Aatish Bhatia, according to ANI. “We are identifying others based on CCTV footage.
