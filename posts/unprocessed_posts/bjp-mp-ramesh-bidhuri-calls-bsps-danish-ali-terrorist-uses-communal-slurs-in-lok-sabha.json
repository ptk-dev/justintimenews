Singh stated that he did not hear what Bidhuri said and urged the Chair to delete the remarks from the proceedings if they hurt Opposition members.On Friday, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla took note of Bidhuri’s remarks and warned him of strict action if he repeats such behaviour, officials told PTI.The Bahujan Samaj Party MP told The Indian Express that he drew the Speaker’s attention after Bidhuri said in his speech that “some people wanted Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi to die like a dog”.“I intervened and asked him what he was saying and that no one said that about the honourable prime minister,” Ali said. “Then he called me names which included ‘terrorist’.”On Friday, Ali wrote a letter to Birla requesting him to refer the incident to the committee of privileges for an investigation.“This is most unfortunate and the fact that it has happened in a new Parliament building under your leadership as Speaker is truly heartbreaking for me as a minority member of this great nation and an elected Member of Parliament as well,” Ali said in his letter.Shri @ombirlakota ji, please take it seriously as this is the first attack on parliamentary democracy in the new Parliament building. Shri @rameshbidhuri must be punished as per the rules to save the dignity of the House. pic.twitter.com/YWnPjc7jbR— Kunwar Danish Ali (@KDanishAli) September 22, 2023\n\nOn his part, Harsh Vardhan claimed that his name was being dragged into the “unfortunate incident” and that he hardly heard anything in the Parliament.“While I was no doubt witness to the jugglery of words being thrown at each other [Ali and Bidhuri], the truth of the matter is that in the chaos that existed, I could not clearly hear what was being said,” the former Union minister claimed, according to The Indian Express.I have seen my name trending on Twitter where people have dragged me into this unfortunate incident where two MPs were using unparliamentary language against each other on the floor of the House.
