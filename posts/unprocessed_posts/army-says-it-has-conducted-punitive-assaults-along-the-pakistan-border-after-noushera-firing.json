{"title":"Army says it has conducted ‘punitive assaults’ along the Pakistan LoC after the Nowshera firing","content":"Major General Ashok Narula, in a press briefing on Tuesday, said the Indian Army has been conducting punitive artillery assaults along the Line of Control to deal with “infiltration attempts supported by Pakistani firing” in the Nowshera region. Narula said the action was an attempt by the Army to dominate the border as part of its counter-terrorism operations.With snow melting along the border as summer sets in, there has been an increase in infiltrations along the LoC Narula said, referring to recent incidents in the sector. The Indian Army had alleged on May 1 that Pakistan had mutilated the bodies of two soldiers killed during “unprovoked” exchange of fire near the Line of Control in Noushera. The soldiers were found in the nearby Krishna Ghati sector. Narula said that the Army’s actions, which are being seen as retaliation to the Nowshera firing, caused damage to Pakistan Army posts.“We want peace and tranquillity in Jammu and Kashmir,” he added. Minutes after the Army’s announcement, the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex fell by more than 200 points.#WATCH Pakistani posts destroyed by Indian Army in Nowshera (Jammu and Kashmir) pic.twitter.com/whrWb0wMfg— ANI (@ANI_news) May 23, 2017","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2017-05-23T15:19:30.407359+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/838464-44737-ratfozermy-1487412439.jpg","tags":["Army","Jammu and Kashmir","Indian Army"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/838464/army-says-it-has-conducted-punitive-assaults-along-the-pakistan-border-after-noushera-firing"}
