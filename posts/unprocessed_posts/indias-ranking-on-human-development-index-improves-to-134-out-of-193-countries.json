The expected years of schooling reached 12.6, while mean years of schooling increased to 6.57 in 2022.Expected years of schooling is the number of years that a child who attains school-going age is likely to spend at an educational institution. Mean years of schooling is the average number of years of education of a country's population aged 25 years and older. This excludes the number of years spent repeating a class.The country’s gross national income per capita has increased to $6951 (Rs 5,75,949.09) from $6,542 (Rs 5,42,059.98), a jump of 6.3% in the span of 12 months, the United Nations Human Development Index showed.“India has shown remarkable progress in human development over the years,” Caitlin Wiesen, the United Nations Development Programme's India representative said. “Since 1990, life expectancy at birth has risen by 9.1 years; expected years of schooling have increased by 4.6 years, and mean years of schooling have grown by 3.8 years.”The report also said that with India’s Gender Inequality Index value of 0.437 in 2022, the country fares better than the global average of 0.462 and the South Asian average of 0.478.➡️ India has shown remarkable progress in human development over the years.Read more in 🆕 #HDR2024: https://t.co/gw76WxxxpV pic.twitter.com/0fRCCl2HId— UNDP India (@UNDP_India) March 14, 2024\n\n\nGlobally, Switzerland ranked first in this year’s chart, gaining a score 0.967, which is an increase from its 2021 score of 0.962.
