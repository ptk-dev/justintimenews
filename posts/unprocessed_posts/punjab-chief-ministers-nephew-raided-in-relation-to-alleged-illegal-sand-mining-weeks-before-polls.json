The raids on the chief minister’s nephew come weeks before Punjab Assembly elections scheduled to take place on February 20. The results will be declared on March 10.Speaking to reporters, Channi alleged that he was being targeted with the motive of putting pressure on him ahead of the Assembly polls, ANI reported. “When there were polls in West Bengal, such attacks took place on Mamata Banerjee’s relatives,” Channi said, according to PTI. “Now, in the same pattern in Punjab, Enforcement Directorate is trying to put pressure and give trouble.”Asked if he sees political vendetta behind the raids, Channi told reporters: “You know what all programmes happened during the past few days...Now this attempt to put pressure on me and the Punjab Congress will not succeed.”Other Congress leaders also alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party was misusing the central agency.

He claimed that his party leader Raghav Chadha had shown that illegal sand mining was taking place at Channi’s own Assembly constituency Chamkaur Sahib.“Despite uncovering it, the chief minister did not take action and even tried to justify it,” Kejriwal said. “It is clear that he [Channi] and his family are involved in illegal sand mining. What can be expected for Punjab’s future from a person whose family is involved in illegal mining.”","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-01-18T11:12:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/166484-bvuuquyafn-1637166753.jpg","tags":["Punjab elections","Charanjit Singh Channi","Bhupinder Singh Honey","Congress","Enforcement Directorate","money laundering","illegal sand mining"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1015293/punjab-chief-ministers-nephew-raided-in-relation-to-alleged-illegal-sand-mining-weeks-before-polls"}
