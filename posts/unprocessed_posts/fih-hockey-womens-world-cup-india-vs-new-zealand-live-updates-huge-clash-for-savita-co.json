Join us on July 10, at 21:30 hrs IST (tentatively), when India plays either South Korea or hosts Spain, at the Estadi Olimpic de Terrassa, for a spot in the quarterfinal.A gripping and often fiesty 60 minutes of hockey, as India lost 3-4 to New Zealand. The Black Sticks top Pool B and are through to the quarterfinals. But India are, on paper, still in contention of winning this FIH World Cup. They next play the winner of Spain and South Korea in the crossover. A win in that match will take India through to the quarterfinals against Australia.That‚Äôs still a while away, but the team in blue have begun to dream of making it big on the greatest stages of the sport.

India can now either finish 1st and go to quarterfinals straight, or 3rd and enter crossovers, or worst case, 4th as well. Good news for India (and hope they see it that way) is that the top spot & a direct quarterfinals berth is up for grabs with a win. That‚Äôs a huge incentive. Won‚Äôt be easy.

A positive goal difference always takes precedence over a  negative one. c) If there still remains equality among two or  more teams, then these teams will be ranked according to their  respective number of ‚Äúgoals for‚Äù. d) Should there still remain  equality among two teams, then the result of the match played between  those teams will determine the ranking of the tied teams.

A draw means India will finish third and will have to play either South Korea or Spain for a spot in the quarterfinals.
