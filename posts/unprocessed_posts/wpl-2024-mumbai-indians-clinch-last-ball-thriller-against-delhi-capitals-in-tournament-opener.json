Kerr, however, got the last laugh when she caught Capsey leg before wicket for 75 in the 18th over.The Capitals had already pushed for a competitive total. Rodrigues then combined with South Africaâ€™s Marizanne Kapp to add a final flourish to the innings as the Capitals finished with a total of 171/5.However, it did not prove to be enough in what turned out to be a thriller.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-02-23T23:51:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/198727-itloofkrfu-1708712090.jpg","tags":["WPL 2024","Women's Premier League","Cricket","Harmanpreet Kaur","Meg Lanning","Women's cricket","S Sajana","Alice Capsey"]}
