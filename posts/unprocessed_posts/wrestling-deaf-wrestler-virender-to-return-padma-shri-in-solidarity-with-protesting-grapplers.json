He is also an Arjuna Award recipient. This development comes after the 2016 Rio Olympics bronze medallist Malik announced her retirement after the former Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bushan Sharan Singh’s close aide Sanjay Singh was elected as the new president of the sports body on Thursday.“We slept on roads for 40 days,” Malik had then said in a press conference. “We fought with all our heart but if the president is like Brij Bushan Sharan Singh – his close aide and business partner – if he stays in the federation then I sacrifice my wrestling career.”In January this year, top Indian wrestlers including Punia, Malik, Phogat, and others had launched a protest against Brij Bushan Sharan Singh, a sitting Bhartiya Janta Party MP, accusing him of intimidation and sexual harassment.The protest was restarted in April at Jantar Mantar and the wrestler’s spent more than a month at the protest site after no action was taken against the then president.Brij Bushan was then asked to step down from his post and an ad-hoc committee was appointed to run the daily affairs of the federation until a fresh election was conducted on Thursday.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-12-23T17:17:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/154113-lmdwxpuerx-1612004059.jpg","tags":["Wrestling","Virender Singh","Bajrang Punia","Padma Shri","Narendra Modi","Sakshi Malik","Vinesh Phogat"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1061039/wrestling-deaf-wrestler-virender-to-return-padma-shri-in-solidarity-with-protesting-grapplers"}
