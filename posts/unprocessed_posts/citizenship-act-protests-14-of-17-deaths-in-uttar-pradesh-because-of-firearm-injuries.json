Late on Sunday, police said that a 28-year-old HIV positive patient succumbed to firearm injuries sustained during Friday’s protests in Kanpur. Thirteen others who died because of firing were identified as 32-year-old Mohammed Wakeel from Lucknow, Aftab Alam and Mohammad Saif from Kanpur, Anas, 21, and Mohammed Suleiman, 35, from Bijnor, Bilal, 24, and 23-year-old Mohammad Shehroz in Sambhal, 33-year-old Jaheer, 28-year-old Mohsin, 20-year-olds Asif and Areef in Meerut; 24-year-old Nabi Jahan in Firozabad and, Faiz Khan, 24, in Rampur.Among the three other deaths was an eight-year-old boy who died of injuries after a stampede in Varanasi, and 35-year-old Rashid who succumbed to head injuries.

An unidentified police spokesperson in Lucknow said that the autopsy report of Daulatganj resident Wakeel confirmed death due to a “firearm injury”.  “It mentions blackening near the exit spot, suggesting that he was shot from close range,” he said.Circle Officer Manoj Kumar Gupta confirmed that Alam and Saif died in Kanpur due to firearm injuries sustained “during violence that took place near the mosque in Nayi Basti”.
