{"title":"Watch: From Shillong to Kerala, Indians protest against Citizenship Act amendments","content":"The protests against the amendments to the Citizenship Act spread from the North East to several parts of India on Friday. While Assam, which was the epicentre of the protests over the past few days, was largely peaceful, violence was reported in Meghalaya and Delhi. Students of the Jamia Millia University were baton-charged by the Delhi Police during a march, while more than 100 people were detained in Tamil Nadu’s Salem and Chennai cities. Thousands of protestors marched towards the Raj Bhavan in Shillong in the afternoon, while in Guwahati, Assam, a 10-hour fast was held as form of a protest.The contentious amendments will allow citizenship to persecuted people of six communities – but not Muslims – from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, provided they have resided in India for six years. The cut-off date is December 31, 2014. The amendments were approved by both Houses of Parliament this week and were signed into law by President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday night.Two people were killed in Assam on Thursday as demands to withdraw the changes to the 1955 law were raised. The widespread fear in the North East is that populations defined as indigenous to the region will be culturally and physically overrun by migrants as a result of these changes.DelhiStudents of Jamia Millia Islamia University and the police clashed in Delhi. At least 50 people were detained after the protests turned violent. Officials have also banned large gatherings in the area.Hundreds of students had gathered for a march to Parliament House from the university campus to voice their opposition to the legislation. Visuals showed police used tear gas and batons to disperse the students. Reports said a few protestors were injured in the clash.The students alleged that the police baton-charged them while they were marching peacefully, but the police claimed the protestors attacked them first. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation closed the Patel Chowk and Janpath stations for a brief period of time due to protests. They were opened about an hour later.This is happening in Delhi right now.
