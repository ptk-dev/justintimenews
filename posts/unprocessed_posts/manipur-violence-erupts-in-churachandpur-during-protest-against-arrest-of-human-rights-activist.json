The police fired tear gas shells to disperse the crowd, according to The Times of India.Over 10 protestors and three policemen were injured in the clashes.Meanwhile, the police have banned gathering of more than five people under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.In a statement, the human rights body alleged that that the protest was peaceful until the crowd was stopped by the police. Despite repeated requests, the district authorities had refused to give permission for the protest, said Mang Vaiphei, member of the International Human Rights Association.The human rights body also said that Section 153(A) has been “gravely misused” by the Manipur government, reported The Indian Express.“The arrest at most is an apparent bias of the government of Manipur against the Kukis, implicit in the majoritarian shift of Manipur government towards a Meitei-centric Government,” read the statement.It also questioned why groups who promote enmity between communities by describing Kukis as foreigners have not been arrested instead.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-05-26T15:06:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/174940-uswzlfwldi-1653557570.jpg","tags":["human rights activist arrested","violence in Manipur","International Human Rights Association","Manipur Police","Section 144"]}
