A good week with some positives for Sindhu, but a question of how she can recover from this. She is not one to usually to fuss over the odd bad result, and mentally strong enough to bounce back. But definitely, there is a need to iron out the situation with her coaching soon for starters.

PV Sindhu will be in action in the final at the Spain Masters Super 300 today in Madrid. She is the last Indian standing at the event.It’s not been the easiest of starts to the season for PV Sindhu, but here she is today, in her first final appearance of the year. And the first final since CWG 2022 last year, that actually saw her take a lengthy break due to a fracture on her ankle. She will be taking on one of the most improved players on tour, in Indonesia’s Gregoria Mariska Tunjung. The world No 12 has had some big wins in the last few months and she added the name of Carolina Marin to that list on Saturday as she defeated the home favourite in three games with a remarkable turnaround. This is the 8th meeting between Sindhu and former junior world champ Tunjung and while Sindhu has won all 7 matches in the past, this will be anything but straightforward.\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    #SpainMastersSuper300 #Badminton 🏸It will be PV Sindhu vs Gregoria Mariska Tunjung, a clash between world No 11 vs world No 12. The young Indonesian stuns top seed Carolina Marin with a superb fightback and prevents a rematch of the Rio 2016 final.  https://t.co/5JDKaQRVrI pic.twitter.com/MYfICLdoga— The Field (@thefield_in) April 1, 2023\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Screenshots in the blog via BWF TV / Tournament Software / Viacom18","author":"Vinayakk Mohanarangan","time":"2023-04-02T16:45:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/188677-ddbdufrrno-1680445684.jpeg","tags":["BWF World Tour","Badminton","Indian badminton","Spain Masters","Spain Masters Super 300"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1046689/badminton-spain-masters-super-300-final-live-scores-reactions-pv-sindhu-takes-on-gregoria-mariska-tunjung"}
