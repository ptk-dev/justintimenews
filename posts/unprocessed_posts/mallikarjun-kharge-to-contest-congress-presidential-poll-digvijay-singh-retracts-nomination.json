The last date to file nominations is Friday.Earlier today, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge also announced his candidature for the party’s presidential poll, PTI reported.Soon after Kharge’s announcement, Digvijaya Singh, who on Thursday had said that he will contest the poll, retracted his nomination.
