In order to salvage the situation, the Congress formed a three-member panel for addressing Pilot’s concerns. Pilot was then removed from the posts of deputy chief minister and state Congress president.In more recent times, Gehlot has called Pilot a traitor, while the latter has held a day-long fast and a foot march to urge his own government to take action against alleged corruption that took place during the previous Bharatiya Janata Party regime.On May 10, Pilot had said that Gehlot considers BJP’s Vasundhara Raje as his leader instead of former Congress president Sonia Gandhi. The development came after the Rajasthan chief minister had claimed that three BJP leaders, including Raje, had helped save his government when the MLAs led by Pilot had staged a revolt in 2020.On May 19, the feud came out in the open after supporters of both leaders had got into a fistfight in Ajmer during a feedback meeting.Congress will not pacify leaders with posts: GehlotAhead of Monday’s meeting, Gehlot had said that there is no tradition in the Congress to offer any position to any leader or worker to pacify him, reported The Indian Express.He made the remarks in response to a question about whether an arrangement was being worked by the Congress to appease Pilot.“I have not heard such a thing before…there is no such tradition in the Congress where any leader demands something and the party high command offers to give that position,” he said. “We have not heard of such a formula ever.”Gehlot also denied media reports that said Pilot could be again appointed as the Rajasthan Congress president.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-05-30T09:38:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190722-igxqfvluck-1685417882.jpg","tags":["Rajasthan","Ashok Gehlot","Sachin Pilot","Congress"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1050020/ashok-gehlot-and-sachin-pilot-have-agreed-to-fight-rajasthan-polls-unitedly-says-congress"}
