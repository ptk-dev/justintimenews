The majority of those killed were Muslims.Statements of the BJP leadersOn February 23, 2020, Mishra had amassed a crowd and gave an ultimatum to the police to clear streets of protesters who were demonstrating against the Citizenship Act amendments in JafrabadIn  the presence of a senior police officer, the BJP leader had demanded  that the police evict the protestors and threatened violence in case  they failed to do so within three days.At a rally in January 2020, Thakur was heard shouting “desh ke gaddaron ko” and the crowd responded with “goli maaro saalon ko”.
