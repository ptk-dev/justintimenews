The police attempted to stop them by using batons.Sarma shared videos of the incident on social media and said: “These are not part of Assamese culture. We are a peaceful state. Such ‘naxalite tactics’ are completely alien to our culture”.Earlier, Sarma had said that Gandhi will be arrested after the Lok Sabha elections, The Times of India reported.The Opposition party has accused the supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party of attempting to disrupt their march and vandalise its posters in Assam.On Tuesday, Gandhi said that Sarma is the most corrupt chief minister in the country and Assam is reeling under massive unemployment, corruption and inflation.“Stopping me from visiting temples, university, preventing ‘padyatra’ is part of intimidation tactics,” said Gandhi. “We do not get intimidated.”The Congress MP was scheduled to visit the University of Science and Technology in Meghalaya’s Ri Bhoi district, near the border with Assam on Tuesday. But he alleged that he had been barred from interacting with the students on the orders of Union Home Minister Amit Shah.On Monday, the Wayanad MP alleged that the Assam authorities prevented him from visiting the Batadrava Satra shrine, the birthplace of 15th-century scholar and reformer Srimanta Sankardeva in Nagaon.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-01-24T08:44:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/193973-wfqioqgkct-1694411935.jpg","tags":["Rahul Gandhi","Himanta Biswa Sarma","Assam Police","Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra"]}
