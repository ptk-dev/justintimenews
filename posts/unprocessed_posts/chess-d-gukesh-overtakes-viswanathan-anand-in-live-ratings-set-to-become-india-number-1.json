A top-three finish here will also propel him to the 2024 Candidates tournament and give him a chance to challenge the current world champion Ding Liren.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-08-04T10:17:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/192852-fluhlgvfpv-1691124058.jpeg","tags":["Chess","FIDE World Cup","Dommaraju Gukesh","Viswanathan Anand","Indian Chess","D Gukesh"]}
