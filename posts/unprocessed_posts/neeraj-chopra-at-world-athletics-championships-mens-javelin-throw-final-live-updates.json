Another first for the Indian athlete who is breaking new ground pretty much every step of the way. Anderson Peters started as the favourite as we had written in our preview on Saturday, and he laid the marker down early. That added a new kind of challenge for the Indian who has been recently setting the pace himself, so to speak. But today he responded to a big challenge, under pressure from Vadlejch and Weber, to find that one big throw when it mattered. The big 90 eluded him, but his 88.13 is still the fourth best throw of his career, and the top four have all come in 2022. \n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n     Neeraj Chopra's top 10 throws \n    \n       Date  Competition  Result \n    \n     30 JUN 2022  BAUHAUS-Galan, Olympiastadion, Stockholm  89.94 (NR)  14 JUN 2022  Paavo Nurmi Games, Paavo Nurmi Stadium, Turku  89.30  21 JUL 2022  World Athletics Championships, Oregon 2022, Hayward Field, Eugene, OR  88.39  23 JUL 2022  World Athletics Championships, Oregon 2022, Hayward Field, Eugene, OR  88.13  27 AUG 2018  Jakarta Asian Games, Jakarta  88.06  05 MAR 2021  Indian Grand Prix 3, Patiala  88.07  28 JAN 2020  ACNW League Meeting 1, McArthur Stadium, Potchefstroom  87.86  17 MAR 2021  Federation Cup, Patiala  87.80  07 AUG 2021  The XXXII Olympic Games, National Stadium, Tokyo  87.58  04 MAY 2018  Doha IAAF Diamond League, Suhaim bin Hamad Stadium, Doha  87.43 \n   via World Athletics \n\n    \n\n    #WorldAthleticsChamps #WCHOregon22🥇 Anderson Peters 🇬🇩🥈 Neeraj Chopra 🇮🇳🥉 Jakub Vadlejch 🇨🇿https://t.co/UMav2KdH1n pic.twitter.com/p5EJHx2WKd— The Field (@thefield_in) July 24, 2022\n\n\n\n        \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Some reactions to Neeraj Chopra’s incredible feat:\n    \n        \n        \n            \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n    Celebrations break out at @Neeraj_chopra1's residence.
