On Friday, protests had erupted in several cities of the country, including Prayagraj.Earlier on Sunday, the Prayagraj Development Authority had asked Mohammed‚Äôs family to vacate the house by 11 am. The authority claimed that it had given a show cause notice to Mohammed, on May 10, asking him to appear for a hearing before it on May 24. However, he did not comply.Somaiya Fatima, the younger daughter of Mohammed, told Scroll.in that the family had not been served any notice about the alleged illegality of their house. Mohammed‚Äôs lawyer also questioned the legality of the demolition claiming that it belonged to his wife, but the order did not mention her name.Somaiya Fatima told Scroll.in that she and her mother had also been detained late on Saturday. They were released on Sunday morning.#WATCH | Demolition of the \"illegally constructed\" residence of Prayagraj violence accused Javed Ahmed underway, after the Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA) earlier put a demolition notice at the residence. pic.twitter.com/p1okHrFyz7‚Äî ANI UP/Uttarakhand (@ANINewsUP) June 12, 2022\n\nWhile there are no provisions under Indian law to demolish the home of anyone accused of a crime, this pattern has been regularly observed across Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled states.

If our property was truly illegal, then why did they not come and give us these notices early. This is an incredibly hard time for us.‚ÄùSomaiya Fatima said that she and her mother, 50-year-old Parveen Fatima, were detained by the Prayagraj Police around 12.30 am on Sunday and taken to the city‚Äôs Civil Lines female police station.‚ÄúThey only told us that they wanted to speak to us about something and then they will let us go,‚Äù she told Scroll.in. ‚ÄúThey started with asking us strange questions like what are the kind of conversations we have at home and what are the kind of posts we share. They were trying to get something controversial out of us, but none of that is even true. We only speak the truth.‚ÄùSomaiya Fatima said that while women police officers tried to get them to talk, a male officer abused her mother and said that force should be used to make them ‚Äúspill the truth‚Äù.The police also asked Somaiya and Parveen Fatima to call home and ask the family members to vacate the house. After they were released around 8 am on Sunday, Somaiya and Parveen Fatima were taken to their relatives‚Äô homes instead of their own home.‚ÄúThey [The police] videographed us, our relatives, their home and asked us to not leave this place,‚Äù Somaiya Fatima  said. She added that the family still does not know about the whereabouts of her father.Petition filed against the demolitionKamal Krishna Roy, a lawyer of the Mohammed family, told Scroll.in that a petition has been filed in the Allahabad High Court challenging the demolition.In a letter to the chief justice, Roy and other lawyers have argued that the house was registered under the name of Parveen Fatima, the wife of Javed Mohammed. Documents from the Prayagraj civic authorities showed Parveen Fatima‚Äôs name on them.‚ÄúThe house was a gift from her [Parveen Fatima] father,‚Äù Roy told Scroll.in. ‚ÄúUnder Muslim Personal Law when a woman gets a property...It does not automatically belong to her husband. The notice that the government has issued is against Javed Mohammad, but the property does not belong to him.‚Äù\n<figure class=\"cms-block-image\">\n  <picture style=\"padding-bottom: 75.0%\">\n    <img src=\"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/inline/gacckfbkjr-1655024036.jpeg\">\n  </picture><figcaption>A receipt from the Water Department of Prayagraj civic body bearing Fatima's name.
