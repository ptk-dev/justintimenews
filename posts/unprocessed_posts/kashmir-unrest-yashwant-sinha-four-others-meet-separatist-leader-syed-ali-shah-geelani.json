The move is being seen as a positive one after the head of the Hurriyat Conference had refused to meet an all-party delegation on September 4.  Sinha told the Hindustan Times that the meeting was cordial and continued for more than an hour. He said that the purpose of their visit was to share \"grievances and pain\". \"I hope the state of unrest will be resolved soon.‚Äù Sinha, however, clarified that it was not an official delegation from the party.The BJP has distanced itself from the meeting. \"It is not a BJP delegation. The BJP has nothing to do with this,\" National Secretary Shrikant Sharma told PTI.The team will also hold meetings with civil society and trade groups like the Kashmir Economic Alliance and the Kashmir Centre for Social and Developmental Studies. Besides, they are also scheduled to meet Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and Governor NN Vohra.This is the second time in the past three-and-a-half months that an attempt has been made by the government to speak with the separatists in order to a solve the crisis in the Valley.
