Protest against suspension of Opposition MPsThe other reason for the protests is the suspension of the 12 Opposition MPs, which has led to a tumultuous Winter Session that saw multiple disruptions.The five Opposition parties, whose MPs were suspended from Rajya Sabha on November 29, skipped a meeting with the Centre on Monday to discuss the stalemate in Parliament.The suspended MPs are Elamaram Kareem of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Congress’ Phulo Devi Netam, Chhaya Verma, R Bora, Rajamani Patel, Syed Nasir Hussain and Akhilesh Prasad Singh, Communist Party of India’s Binoy Viswam, Trinamool Congress’ Dola Sen and Shanta Chhetri, and Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi and Anil Desai.They were suspended for allegedly being unruly and violent during the Monsoon Session in August. The session was marked by disruptions in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha because of the Pegasus spyware row and the farm laws.Fifteen Opposition parties have been protesting against the suspension for the last two weeks and have now intensified their agitation.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2021-12-21T18:27:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/167838-ufpbqpcaiq-1640088561.jpg","tags":["Opposition protest","Lakhimpur Kheri","Ajay Mishra","Rahul Gandhi"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1013347/opposition-demands-union-minister-ajay-mishras-removal-protests-against-suspension-of-mps"}
