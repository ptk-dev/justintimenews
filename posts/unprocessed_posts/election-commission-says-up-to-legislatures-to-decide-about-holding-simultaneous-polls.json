However, the Congress had claimed the proposal was against federalism, and that it is “unconstitutional, undemocratic and forbidden by law”. The party had also described the proposal as a “constitutional perversity”. Communist Party of India (Marxist) had also termed the moves as “fundamentally anti-federal and anti-democratic”.The BJP has claimed that the opposition to the idea of simultaneous national and state elections is “politically motivated and inappropriate”.In November 2020, Modi had also suggested the creation of a single voters’ list for national, state and panchayat elections.The country had simultaneous national and state elections for several  years after Independence, but they later fell out of sync as governments  collapsed mid-term.Explainer: Why the BJP is pushing for simultaneous elections and how will they be implemented","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-11-10T10:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/178718-sndsasmzym-1660978023.jpg","tags":["One Nation One Election","Election","Election Commission"]}
