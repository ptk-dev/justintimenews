They are taking onus,‚Äù India skipper Suryakumar Yadav, who won his second successive match as national captain, said.‚ÄúI told them (players) before, be prepared to bat first. There was a lot of dew. We talked to defend it later.‚ÄùJaiswal was named man of the match and said, ‚ÄúIt was really special for me. I was trying to play all my shots. Was trying to be fearless. I was sure of my decisions.‚Äù#Cricket #INDvAUSINDIA WIN BY 44 RUNSüî•A three-for each from Ravi Bishoni and Prasidh Krishna help India to a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.IND: 235/5 (20)AUS: 191/9 (20)üì∏: BCCIhttps://t.co/NT7m104RXX pic.twitter.com/kN0Wv0sDqj‚Äî The Field (@thefield_in) November 26, 2023\n\nJaiswal, who smashed nine fours and two sixes, raced to his fifty in 24 balls but soon fell to fast bowler Nathan Ellis, who got three wickets.Kishan, a wicketkeeper-batsman, raised his fifty with a six off leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha before he got out to Marcus Stoinis.But the left-handed Rinku Singh finished off the innings with a flurry of boundaries and sixes.In reply, Australia fell to 58-4 including Steve Smith (19), previous-match centurion Josh Inglis (two) and Glenn Maxwell (12) back in the dug-out.Tim David, who smashed 37, and Stoinis, who hit 45 off 25 balls, attempted to hit back in their partnership of 81 as the two hit six fours and six sixes between them.Bishnoi broke the stand with his leg-spin to dismiss David who mistimed a hit to long-on.Stoinis was the next to go as the wheels came off the chase and Krishna got two more to nearly end the batting team‚Äôs hopes.Skipper Matthew Wade struck an unbeaten 42 off 23 balls to reduce the margin of loss for Australia, who last week lost the opener four days after being crowned champions of the 2023 ICC Men‚Äôs ODI World Cup.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre making the right decisions but aren‚Äôt executing in the right moments,‚Äù Australia coach Andre Borovec said.The third T20I of the series will be played on Tuesday in Guwahati.","author":"AFP","time":"2023-11-27T09:13:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/196183-lftawejgeh-1701055830.jpeg","tags":["Cricket","Indian Cricket","Yashasvi Jaiswal","Ishan Kishan","Ravi Bishnoi","Australia tour of India","Prasidh Krishna","Ruturaj Gaikwad"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1059666/australia-tour-of-india-yashashvi-jaiswal-ishan-kishan-help-india-to-a-2-0-lead-in-t20i-series"}
