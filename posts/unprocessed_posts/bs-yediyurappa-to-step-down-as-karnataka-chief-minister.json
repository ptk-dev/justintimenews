On Tuesday and Wednesday, the chief minister met several spiritual leaders from across the state. Reports said that the meetings were meant to be a political message to the BJP leadership and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on the support Yediyurappa enjoys among the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community, which makes up for 16% of the state’s population.  Last week, a purported audio clip on a possible “leadership change” in the state was widely shared on social media. The voice on the clip resembled that of Karnataka BJP chief Nalin Kumar Kateel, who denied the claim.A week ago, Yatnal said that the party’s central leadership will soon pick a new chief minister for Karnataka who is “honest, pro-Hindu and capable of bringing the BJP back to power”. Yatnal, one of the strongest voices in the anti-Yediyurappa camp, had called him “inactive” and asked him to retire respectfully.Meanwhile, Yediyurappa, along with his son, met multiple BJP leaders, including Modi and Nadda earlier this month and dismissed speculations about his resignation. He had then said that there was no truth in the rumours.In May, a controversy began after the state government approved the sale of 3,667 acres of land to JSW Steel in Bellary. Yediyurappa had himself protested when the former Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) government wanted to execute the deal.Some MLAs also claimed that Yediyurappa’s family members were not allowing them to choose contractors of their choice for development projects.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2021-07-26T12:18:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/161961-njyyyfbkmb-1627281712.jpg","tags":["BS Yediyurappa","Karnataka","Karnataka chief minister"]}
