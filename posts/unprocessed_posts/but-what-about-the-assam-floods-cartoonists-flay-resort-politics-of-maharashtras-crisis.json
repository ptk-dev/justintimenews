At the time, BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis had claimed the support of some Nationalist Congress Party legislators, including current Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, and formed the government following an early morning ceremony. The government had collapsed within two days after most Nationalist Congress Party legislators withdrew support.#MaharashtraPolitics #ShivsenaMLA @DainikBhaskar pic.twitter.com/1TjMoLrB9T‚Äî Mansoor Naqvi (@cartoonistnaqvi) June 21, 2022\n\nCartoonist Alok referred to Shinde‚Äôs claim that he had rebelled for the ‚Äúsake of Hindutva‚Äù.pic.twitter.com/dV4nt7joKF‚Äî Cartoonist Alok (@caricatured) June 23, 2022\n\nSome referenced International Yoga Day, which was held on June 21.#YogaDay #yoga #yogaday2022 #MVA #Cartoon #MANJULtoons #MaharashtraMLCElection2022 pic.twitter.com/2auxNrBmdQ‚Äî MANJUL (@MANJULtoons) June 21, 2022\n\npic.twitter.com/UMgI0Pezzr‚Äî Cartoonist Alok (@caricatured) June 21, 2022","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-06-23T19:26:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/176182-npvystfwna-1655982282.jpeg","tags":["Maharashtra","Assam","Maharashtra Politics","Maha Vikas Aghadi"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1026778/but-what-about-the-assam-floods-cartoonists-flay-resort-politics-of-maharashtras-crisis"}
