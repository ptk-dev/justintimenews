{"title":"International Olympic Committee says sanctions against Russia and Belarus athletes ‘non negotiable’","content":"The International Olympic Committee on Tuesday rebuffed a Russian  demand that its athletes be treated the same as those of other  countries, in a growing row over Russian and Belarusian participation in  the 2024 Paris Games.“The sanctions against the Russian and Belarusian state and governments are not negotiable,” an IOC spokesperson said.The debate had intensified since the IOC said last week it was  examining a “pathway” for Russians to compete in Paris, probably as  neutral athletes rather than under their national flag.International Olympic Committee calls for ban on Russians from world sport  That sparked a furious response from Kyiv, with a Ukrainian presidential aide accusing the IOC of being a “promoter of war”.Ukraine threatened to boycott the Paris Games if Russians were allowed to take part.On Tuesday, Stanislav Pozdnyakov, the head of Russia’s Olympic Committee, argued for full participation.“Russians must participate exactly on the same conditions as all  other athletes. Any additional conditions or criteria are unwelcome,  especially any that have political overtones, which are completely  unacceptable for the Olympic movement,” Pozdnyakov said, according to  Russian news agencies.Russia and its ally Belarus, which allowed its territory to be used  as a launchpad when Moscow started its offensive in Ukraine last  February, have been sidelined from most Olympic sports since the  conflict began.Pozdnyakov said his organisation welcomed efforts by the IOC to allow Russian athletes to compete. “But as for additional conditions, we strongly disagree. The Olympic  Charter states that all athletes must participate on an equal footing,”  he added.The IOC quickly pushed back saying the sanctions against Russia and  Belarus had “been unanimously confirmed by the recent Olympic summit  meeting on December 9”.Those sanctions included “no flag, anthem, colours or any other  identifications whatsoever of these countries being displayed at any  sports event or meeting, including the entire venue”, said the IOC  spokesperson.Ahead of the IOC response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  said Russia’s participation in the Paris Olympics would amount to  showing that “terror can allegedly be something acceptable”.Last week, Zelensky said he had invited IOC president Thomas Bach to  visit the frontline Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, “so that he can see for  himself that neutrality does not exist”.Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday that of the  71 medals that Russian competitors won at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 45  went to athletes who were members of the Central Sports Club of the  Russian Army, or CSKA.“The army that commits atrocities, kills, rapes, and loots,” Kuleba  said. “This is whom the ignorant IOC wants to put under (the) white flag  allowing (them) to compete.”‘Russian propaganda efforts’Latvia’s  Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said on Tuesday his country opposed  any participation of Russian athletes at the Paris Olympics, saying it  would be “immoral and wrong”.After a meeting with his counterparts from the Baltic states and  Poland in Riga, Rinkevics called for Russia to be isolated as long as it  continues its offensive in Ukraine.“As all tyrannies do, it uses sports for political purposes. IOC  should not become complicit in Russian propaganda efforts,” Rinkevics  said.The Olympic Council of Asia, however, last week offered Russian and  Belarusian athletes the chance to compete in this year’s Asian Games,  arguing that “all athletes, regardless of their nationality or the  passport they hold, should be able to compete in sports competitions”.That was a significant move because it would allow athletes from  those two countries to achieve qualifying standards they would need to  compete in Paris.The IOC reiterated last week that the international federations for  each Olympic sport were “the sole authority for its international  competitions”.","author":"AFP","time":"2023-02-01T10:20:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/138815-dkzwqcxyxx-1585034184.jpg","tags":["International Olympic Committee","IOC","Russia","Belarus","War in Ukraine"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1043010/international-olympic-committee-says-sanctions-against-russia-and-belarus-athletes-non-negotiable"}
