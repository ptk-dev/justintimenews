A bench of Justices Adarsh Goel and UU Lalit added that there shall be no absolute prohibition on granting anticipatory bail to public servants booked under the Act.The bench said that the public servant can be arrested only after the authority, which has appointed him, approves it. If the accused is not a public servant, he can be arrested after the senior superintendent of police of the district concerned grants permission, Bar and Bench reported.The Supreme Court added that failure to follow these directives would entail disciplinary action and proceedings for contempt of court, Live Law reported.","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2018-03-20T15:15:23.557487+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/872677-49245-ujvfdcjhoe-1521537771.jpg","tags":["Supreme Court","public servant","Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/872677/no-public-servant-can-be-arrested-under-the-sc-st-act-without-inquiry-prior-sanction-supreme-court"}
