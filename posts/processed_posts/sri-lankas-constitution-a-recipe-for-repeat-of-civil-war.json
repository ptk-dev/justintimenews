{"title":"Sri Lanka's Constitution: A Recipe for Repeat of Civil War?","content":"\nSri Lanka's new constitution is sparking controversy with plans to give Buddhism a \"foremost place,\" raising fears of discrimination against minorities. This decision has ignited a debate about the country's future, echoing past conflicts.\n\nThe move, supported by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena, has been met with fierce opposition from Tamil groups who fear a return to the discrimination that fueled the 25-year civil war.  \n\nThe Tamil National Alliance, a key player in Sirisena's election victory, warns that giving primacy to Buddhism could lead to further suppression of minority religions and communities. They argue that secularism is crucial for a diverse nation like Sri Lanka.\n\nThe government maintains that acknowledging Buddhism's special place does not equate to making it the state religion. However, the historical context of Sinhalese-Tamil tensions and the rise of extremist Buddhist groups paints a grim picture. \n\nThe debate over Sri Lanka's new constitution is not just about religion; it's about the future of a nation grappling with the scars of a brutal conflict.  Will the new constitution address the concerns of minorities and prevent a repeat of history, or will it solidify the very divisions that led to the civil war?  \n","tags":["Buddhism","Sri Lanka","constitution"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/820709/will-sri-lankas-new-constitution-retain-the-mistakes-that-led-to-25-years-of-civil-war","author":"Sruthisagar Yamunan","time":"2016-11-07T10:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/820709-44881-rmyvypcyef-1478463398.jpg","id":"ab7f789d-2002-5342-bc83-6fe31203d694"}
