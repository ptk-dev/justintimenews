{"title":"Indian Greco-Roman Wrestlers Miss Out on Paris 2024 Olympic Berth at Asian Qualifiers","content":"\nIndia's hopes for a Greco-Roman wrestling quota at the 2024 Paris Olympics were dashed at the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.  Despite a strong start from Sunil Kumar in the 87kg category, the Indian team failed to secure a single Olympic berth.\n\nThe disappointing performance follows a successful outing for India's women wrestlers, who secured four Olympic quotas at the event. However, the lack of success in Greco-Roman wrestling leaves India with a single chance to secure a quota in the discipline at the World Olympic Qualifiers in Turkey in May. \n\nThis setback highlights the ongoing challenges faced by Indian Greco-Roman wrestlers, who have struggled to maintain their presence on the international stage. \n","tags":["Asian Olympic Qualifiers","Greco-Roman wrestling","Sumit","Wrestling","Indian wrestling","2024 Paris Olympic Games"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1066885/wrestling-asian-olympic-qualifiers-indian-greco-roman-wrestlers-end-campaign-on-disappointing-note","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-04-21T16:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/162507-zcjkzcbfrw-1693369752.jpg","id":"e899117f-494c-5bc8-bfb2-2cced5e1f1af"}
