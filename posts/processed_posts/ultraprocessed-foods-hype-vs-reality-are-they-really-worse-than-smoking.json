{"title":"Ultra-Processed Foods: Hype vs. Reality - Are They Really Worse Than Smoking?","content":"\nThere's a lot of buzz about ultra-processed foods being harmful, even worse than smoking. But is this hype justified? \n\nWhile it's true that diets high in ultra-processed foods are linked to poorer health, the science isn't as clear-cut as some claim. **Many studies are observational, meaning they can't prove cause and effect**.  \n\nIt's possible that other factors, like poverty or mental health, are influencing both ultra-processed food consumption and health outcomes.  \n\nFurthermore, **not all ultra-processed foods are created equal**.  Some, like brown bread, are actually linked to improved health. \n\nThe real issue may not be the processing itself, but the high amounts of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats in many of these products. \n\nWhile more research is needed, **overstating the dangers of ultra-processed foods can create unnecessary anxiety**, and may distract from tackling the real culprits â€“ sugary drinks, processed meats, and unhealthy marketing practices. \n\n**Let's focus on the evidence-based facts and make informed choices about our diets.** \n","tags":["Food","Food Processing","Health"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1062226/worse-than-smoking-how-true-are-the-claims-ultra-processed-foods-are-bad-for-health","author":"Eric Robinson, The Conversation","time":"2024-01-20T22:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/197569-kjznvocczr-1705404169.jpg","id":"a59031aa-0de6-5ccc-b23d-812812d932eb"}
