Led by India captain Harmanpreet Kaur, they boast a formidable squad packed with international all-rounders like Natalie Sciver-Brunt, Hayley Matthews, and Amelia Kerr. This star-studded lineup promises exciting cricket and a fierce competition for the title.\n\nTheir strength lies in their all-rounders, with a deep batting order led by Sciver-Brunt, one of the best all-rounders in women's cricket. However, their reliance on overseas spinners might be a concern, especially towards the end of the tournament.\n\nThe team's coaching staff, led by Charlotte Edwards, is also a force to be reckoned with, bringing a wealth of experience and expertise. With a balanced squad and a strong coaching team, Mumbai Indians are poised to be a major contender in the inaugural WPL 2023. \n","tags":["WPL 2023","WPL","Mumbai Indians","Harmanpreet Kaur"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1044818/wpl-2023-mumbai-indians-preview-full-squad-strengths-coaching-staff-schedule","author":"Vinayakk Mohanarangan","time":"2023-03-02T20:10:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/187492-puqwjvejsf-1677766247.jpeg","id":"c77e2fe2-dccd-5b75-abd6-0d2ee165950c"}
