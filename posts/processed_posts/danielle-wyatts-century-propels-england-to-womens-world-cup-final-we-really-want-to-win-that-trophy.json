{"title":"Danielle Wyatt's Century Propels England to Women's World Cup Final: \"We Really Want to Win That Trophy\"","content":"\nDanielle Wyatt, England's opening batter, played a crucial role in her team's victory over South Africa in the ICC Women's ODI Cricket World Cup 2022 semi-final. Her century, her first in a World Cup, helped set up a mammoth target of 294 for South Africa, a chase they ultimately failed to achieve.\n\nWyatt's knock was a testament to her resilience and determination, coming after she had been dropped five times during her innings. Her performance was also highlighted by the fact that she was able to capitalize on crucial partnerships, particularly with Sophia Dunkley. \n\n\"I woke up this morning and really wanted to contribute to a win today and that's what happened,\" said Wyatt.  \"After those first three games, I didn't think this would be the case, so we'll prepare well for the final and we obviously really want to win that trophy.\"\n\nEngland's victory was also aided by the exceptional bowling of Sophie Ecclestone, who took a maiden international five-wicket haul, finishing with figures of 6 for 36. This helped bowl out South Africa for 156, denying them a place in their first ever World Cup final.  \n\nEngland will now face Australia in the final, hoping to lift the trophy for the fifth time. \n","tags":["world cup","icc women's odi cricket world cup","england cricket team","Danielle Wyatt"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1020813/world-cup-we-really-want-to-win-that-trophy-says-englands-danni-wyatt-after-superb-semifinal-ton","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-03-31T18:22:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/172343-dfctvhdfpo-1648714479.jpeg","id":"ba606ea6-a863-5ecd-ae0e-52cac8e47c89"}
