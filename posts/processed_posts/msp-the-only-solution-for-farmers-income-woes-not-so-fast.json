While the Minimum Support Price (MSP) is a crucial tool, experts warn it's not a magic bullet. This article delves into the complexities of MSP, exploring its limitations and the need for a multi-pronged approach to ensure sustainable farm income. \n\nThe current MSP calculation doesn't consider the true cost of production, prompting farmers to demand a legally binding MSP based on the Swaminathan Commission's recommendations.

Experts emphasize the need for a holistic approach, including better crop diversification, agroecological practices, and direct income support for small farmers and agricultural laborers. \n\nThe article highlights the urgent need for a more sustainable and equitable agricultural system. It explores the challenges of intensive agriculture, excessive groundwater extraction, and the burden of debt on farmers.  The article concludes by urging the government to invest in agricultural research, promote eco-friendly farming practices, and provide comprehensive support for the agricultural workforce. \n","tags":["MSP","Farmers Protest","Agriculture","Minimum Support Price","Punjab","Haryana","Farmers","Fair and Remunerative Price"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1064191/with-climate-change-and-increased-production-cost-msp-alone-is-no-guarantee-of-better-farm-income","author":"Shreehari Paliath, IndiaSpend.com","time":"2024-02-27T19:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/181482-yrglfpqtnu-1666100145.jpg","id":"f9eea991-1591-594c-adc6-6ef45cea80b4"}
