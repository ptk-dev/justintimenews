{"title":"Manipur's Peace Pact: A Step Towards Harmony or a New Chapter in Conflict?","content":"\nManipur's oldest militant group, the United National Liberation Front (UNLF), has signed a peace agreement with the Indian government, marking a significant step in the state's long history of conflict. This agreement, however, has sparked mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a beacon of hope and others fearing it could fuel further tensions. \n\nThe pact, which was decades in the making, comes amidst a brutal ethnic conflict between the Meitei and Kuki communities. The UNLF, primarily representing the Meitei community's interests, has long sought a separate state for Manipur. \n\nWhile the agreement signifies a potential end to the UNLF's armed struggle, many observers remain cautious. The UNLF's other faction, led by RK Achou Singh, continues to operate from Myanmar, highlighting the complexities of the situation. Moreover, the peace pact has raised anxieties within the Kuki-Zo community, who fear that surrendered UNLF cadres might now be used against them in the ongoing conflict. \n\nThe path to peace in Manipur remains long and arduous. The recent peace pact, while a positive development, is only one piece of the puzzle. Addressing the deep-rooted grievances of all communities, including the Kuki-Zo, and fostering dialogue and trust will be crucial in achieving lasting peace in the state. \n","tags":["Meitei militant group","Manipur militancy","UNLF","Manipur","Manipur ethnic violence","SOO groups","N Biren Singh"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1059946/will-the-new-peace-pact-with-meitei-group-unlf-bring-peace-to-manipur","author":"Rokibuz Zaman","time":"2023-12-02T06:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/196254-arkzshxuds-1701266150.jpg","id":"acddb6bd-f2d7-54c5-aa65-25179be588d5"}
