{"title":"Shah Rukh Khan's \"Zero\": A Stumble Into The Void of Outlandishness","content":"\nShah Rukh Khan's latest film, \"Zero,\" attempts a bold narrative about a vertically challenged man's quest for love. The premise, while intriguing, ultimately falls flat due to its outlandish execution.  The film, directed by Aanand L Rai,  features a star-studded cast, including Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif, but despite the A-list talent, \"Zero\" feels more like a bizarre circus act than a compelling romantic comedy.\n\nThe film's central character, Bauua Singh (Khan),  overcompensates for his height with bravado and a John Wayne-esque swagger. However, the  visual effects meant to shrink Khan's stature feel jarring and distracting, undermining the emotional core of the story.  \n\n While Kaif delivers a strong performance as the cynical film star, Babita Kumari,  the overall story lacks the depth and emotional resonance it strives for. \"Zero\" ultimately feels like a missed opportunity,  a grand folly that fails to launch into the realm of captivating cinema. \n","tags":["Shah Rukh Khan","Aanand L Rai","Zero review"],"source":"https://scroll.in/reel/906457/zero-film-review-null-all-the-way-into-the-void","author":"Nandini Ramnath","time":"2018-12-21T08:17:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/108487-jeezfapbxg-1545245311.jpeg","id":"542d41dc-5449-5d83-bef2-c59c3d7cad7c"}
