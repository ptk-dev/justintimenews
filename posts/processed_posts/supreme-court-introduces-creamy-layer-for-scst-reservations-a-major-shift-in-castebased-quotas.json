{"title":"Supreme Court Introduces \"Creamy Layer\" for SC/ST Reservations: A Major Shift in Caste-Based Quotas","content":"\nThe Supreme Court has fundamentally changed the way caste-based reservations work by introducing the \"creamy layer\" concept for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). This means that people from these communities who have achieved significant economic progress will no longer be eligible for reservation benefits. \n\nPreviously, only Other Backward Classes (OBC) were subject to the \"creamy layer\" test, which was designed to ensure that the benefits of reservation reach truly disadvantaged individuals within the community. This move has sparked debate, with some experts arguing that economic advancement doesn't erase the stigma of untouchability and that applying the \"creamy layer\" to SCs and STs is premature. \n\nThe Supreme Court, however, believes this step will promote equality by preventing a small group of economically advanced individuals from monopolizing reserved positions. This landmark decision has significant implications for the future of caste-based reservations in India, and its impact on various sectors, especially government jobs and education, will be closely watched. \n","tags":["Creamy layer","Caste reservations","SC/ST Reservations"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/895981/with-creamy-layer-in-sc-st-quotas-supreme-court-fundamentally-changes-how-caste-reservations-work","author":"Shoaib Daniyal","time":"2018-09-27T06:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/895981-zgptgxldzk-1536304407.jpg","id":"6cc97c0a-a0a9-5d72-b4d6-c3cf67156603"}
