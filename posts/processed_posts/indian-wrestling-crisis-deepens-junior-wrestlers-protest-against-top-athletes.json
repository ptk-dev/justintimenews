{"title":"Indian Wrestling Crisis Deepens: Junior Wrestlers Protest Against Top Athletes","content":"\nThe Indian wrestling crisis has taken a shocking turn with junior wrestlers from across the country protesting against Olympic medalists Sakshi Malik, Bajrang Punia, and Vinesh Phogat. These young athletes, frustrated by the suspension of the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and the cancellation of competitions, blame the senior wrestlers for their lost opportunities. \n\nThe protests stem from the ongoing controversy surrounding former WFI president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, accused of sexual harassment by several wrestlers, including Malik, Punia, and Phogat. While Singh's removal and the election of Sanjay Singh, a close aide, have failed to resolve the crisis, it has sparked further division within the wrestling community. \n\nThis situation highlights the deep-rooted issues within Indian wrestling, where power struggles and lack of accountability continue to affect athletes at all levels. The future of the sport remains uncertain, with the Sports Ministry suspending the newly elected WFI body and appointing a fresh ad-hoc committee. \n","tags":["Wrestling","Bajrang Punia","Sakshi Malik","Vinesh Phogat","Wrestling Federation of India","Wrestlers' Protest"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1061562/wrestling-junior-wrestlers-launch-protests-against-sakshi-malik-bajrang-punia-and-vinesh-phogat","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-01-03T16:23:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190844-pgrnctkham-1685702361.jpg","id":"4c855f1d-fe01-5724-88d2-efdcdff93f2c"}
