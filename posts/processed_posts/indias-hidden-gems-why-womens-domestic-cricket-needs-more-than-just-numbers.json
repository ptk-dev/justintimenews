{"title":"India's Hidden Gems: Why Women's Domestic Cricket Needs More Than Just Numbers","content":"\nThe recent Women's Senior T20 Trophy, a potential launchpad for India's Women's IPL, saw a stellar display of talent but remained largely invisible to the public eye. Despite the presence of top stars like Harmanpreet Kaur and Smriti Mandhana, the tournament lacked the essential visibility that would allow fans to witness the next generation of cricketers. \n\nWhile international women's cricket has gained significant traction, the domestic scene remains largely overlooked. This lack of visibility hinders the growth of the sport, denying young female cricketers the recognition and inspiration they need. \n\nWhile logistical challenges exist, the absence of even basic coverage sends a disheartening message about the importance of women's domestic cricket in India.  Investing in even minimal coverage, like two stationary cameras and basic commentary, would go a long way in showcasing the talent pool and fostering a more inclusive cricketing environment. \n\n**Keywords:** Women's T20 Trophy, India, Domestic Cricket, Visibility, Talent, Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, Women's IPL, Cricket Coverage\n","tags":["ICC Women's Cricket World Cup","Women's IPL","Women's cricket in India","Women's Senior T20 Trophy"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1023070/womens-t20-trophy-even-surrounded-by-stars-indias-domestic-cricket-talent-remains-invisible","author":"Ananya Upendran","time":"2022-05-02T12:05:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/173831-kplvzvwkxd-1651470437.jpeg","id":"9060ec07-f963-5b99-9174-0305c71cffec"}
