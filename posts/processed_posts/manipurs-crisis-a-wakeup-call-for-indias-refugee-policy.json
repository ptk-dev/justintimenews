{"title":"Manipur's Crisis: A Wake-Up Call for India's Refugee Policy","content":"\nThe escalating violence in Manipur, fueled by the influx of refugees fleeing Myanmar's military junta, has exposed a critical gap in India's refugee protection system.  Over 50,000 people are displaced within Manipur, living in overcrowded relief camps without basic amenities. The situation mirrors the global refugee crisis, with over 108 million people displaced worldwide, many facing discrimination and abuse. \n\nIndia's lack of a clear refugee policy, coupled with the government's refusal to grant refugees basic rights like work permits and identity cards, has exacerbated the situation.  This has created a dangerous cycle of fear and distrust, leading to ethnic clashes in Manipur between the local Meitei community and the Kuki-Chin refugees. \n\nThis crisis is a stark reminder of India's moral obligation to uphold the principle of \"Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam\" â€“ the world as one family. It's time for India to enact a comprehensive refugee protection law, ensuring the rights of those seeking refuge and promoting harmony between communities. \n","tags":["Myanmar","Manipur","Refugees","Mizoram","Manipur Violence"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1051142/world-is-family-from-manipur-to-myanmar-the-escalating-refugee-crisis-is-a-wake-up-call-for-india","author":"Nandita Haksar","time":"2023-06-20T09:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/191378-beijektinz-1687139249.jpg","id":"7cd1bd25-f22d-5164-a87b-a5f4e8dc91f4"}
