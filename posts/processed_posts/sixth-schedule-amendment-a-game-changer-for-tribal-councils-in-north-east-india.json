{"title":"Sixth Schedule Amendment: A Game Changer for Tribal Councils in North East India?","content":"\nThe Indian government has announced a constitutional amendment aimed at boosting the financial power of autonomous councils in the North East. This move, dubbed a \"landmark\" and a \"game changer,\" aims to address the long-standing grievance of inadequate funding for these councils. \n\nWhile the amendment promises to increase the influence of the Finance Commission in allocating funds to these councils, many leaders are skeptical. They argue that the amendment falls short of their demand for direct funding from the Centre and increased control over subjects currently managed by state governments. \n\nThe amendment also introduces elected village and municipal councils, a move welcomed by some who believe it will empower grassroots democracy. However, the true impact of the amendment remains unclear, and its effectiveness in achieving its stated goals will be closely watched. \n","tags":["Autonomous Tribal Councils","Sixth Schedule","Chakma Autonomous Council","North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/910844/will-the-centres-landmark-amendment-really-empower-autonomous-tribal-councils-in-the-north-east","author":"Arunabh Saikia","time":"2019-01-26T07:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/111486-erlruklpya-1548436036.jpg","id":"5b7610e1-499e-522d-89c9-e841f56792cf"}
