{"title":"India's Silent Crisis: Why Youth Unemployment Isn't a National Political Issue?","content":"\nIndia's young people are facing a dire situation â€“ soaring unemployment rates. Despite this, the issue is strangely absent from national political discourse. Why?\n\nThe recent dramatic protest in the Lok Sabha, where young people disrupted proceedings to highlight the issue, is a stark reminder of the severity of the problem. While state governments are grappling with the issue, the national conversation remains largely silent. \n\nThe BJP's political dominance and the media's close ties with the party contribute to this silence. Additionally, the complexity of the problem, rooted in India's economic structure and social norms, makes quick fixes seem elusive. \n\nThe absence of national political pressure on this critical issue poses a significant threat to India's future. The country needs a comprehensive strategy to address youth unemployment, one that goes beyond short-term solutions and tackles the underlying economic and social challenges. \n","tags":["unemployment","India Fix","Parliament protest"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1060710/youth-unemployment-is-a-major-problem-in-india-so-why-is-it-absent-from-national-politics","author":"Shoaib Daniyal","time":"2023-12-18T09:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/196726-uzpgjphuso-1702832178.jpg","id":"f2b3d30f-e8ec-5a8a-8de9-cef07ffdfc58"}
