{"title":"India's Fightback Fizzles Out: Can Kohli & Rahane Pull Off a Miracle in WTC Final?","content":"\nIndia's hopes of a miraculous comeback in the ICC World Test Championship Final took a hit on Day 4, despite a thrilling start from Rohit Sharma. \n\nSharma's aggressive intent,  a stark contrast to India's previous subdued performance,  injected hope into the chase of 444 runs. However,  two uncharacteristic dismissals,  one from Sharma himself and another from Cheteshwar Pujara,  saw India collapse from 91/1 to 93/3. \n\nThe momentum shifted back to Australia, but Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane steadied the ship with a crucial 71-run partnership.  Can this veteran duo orchestrate a record-breaking chase on Day 5?  India's fate hinges on their ability to defy the odds and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. \n","tags":["Shubman Gill","Rohit Sharma","Australia","India","Cheteshwar Pujara","WTC Final","ICC World Test Championship"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1050711/wtc-final-day-4-rohit-sharma-led-attacking-start-was-fleetingly-glorious-but-eventually-fell-flat","author":" Samreen Razzaqui","time":"2023-06-11T08:15:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/191115-eaqhzfjwix-1686420943.jpg","id":"8af26604-37ba-5a4e-8dec-f83e4058d780"}
