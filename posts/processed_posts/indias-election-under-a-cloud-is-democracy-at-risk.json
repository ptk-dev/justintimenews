Central agencies under the BJP's control are being used to target opposition leaders, freezing funds and controlling media narratives.  \n\nThe fear of potential jail time for losing elections is creating a dangerous precedent, mirroring similar trends in neighboring countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan.
