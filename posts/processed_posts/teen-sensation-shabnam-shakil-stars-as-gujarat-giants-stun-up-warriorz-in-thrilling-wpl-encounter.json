{"title":"Teen Sensation Shabnam Shakil Stars as Gujarat Giants Stun UP Warriorz in Thrilling WPL Encounter","content":"\nThe Gujarat Giants pulled off a dramatic eight-run victory over the UP Warriorz in a nail-biting Women's Premier League clash, thanks to a sensational bowling performance by 16-year-old Shabnam Shakil. \n\nShakil, playing only her third WPL match, picked up three crucial wickets, including dismissing Australian captain Alyssa Healy in the first over. Her economical spell (3/11) also set a new record for the most economical figures by an Indian bowler in WPL history. \n\nDespite a valiant effort from Deepti Sharma, who scored an unbeaten 88, the Warriorz fell short of the 153-run target, leaving their playoff hopes hanging in the balance. \n\nThis victory keeps the Giants' playoff hopes alive, although they will need a win against the Delhi Capitals in their next match. Meanwhile, the Warriorz's fate now rests on the outcome of the Mumbai Indians vs Royal Challengers Bangalore match. \n","tags":["Shabnam Shakil","UP Warriorz","Gujarat Giants","Beth Mooney","Women's Premier League","WPL 2024","WPL","Indian cricket","Cricket"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1065050/wpl-2024-shabnam-shakils-spell-binds-up-warriorz-as-gujarat-giants-pick-up-gripping-win","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-11T23:45:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/199179-usdaxpzsds-1710180907.jpg","id":"1acfacc6-ca60-5f0e-ab7c-13488018a5d6"}
