{"title":"The Rain Rule That Sank South Africa's World Cup Dreams: A Story of Farcical Calculations and Unfair Rules","content":"\nThe 1992 World Cup semi-final between South Africa and England is a painful memory for Proteas fans.  A bizarre rain rule, designed to benefit the team batting first,  turned the tide in England's favor.  With South Africa needing 22 runs off 13 balls, a rain delay resulted in a farcical calculation, leaving them needing 22 runs from just **one** ball. \n\nThis controversial rule sparked outrage and led to a much-needed overhaul of rain rules. But the incident remains a stark reminder of how unfair and complex rules can impact the outcome of a match, particularly in a high-stakes tournament like the World Cup. It also highlights how even the most talented teams can fall victim to unforeseen circumstances. \n\n**Keywords:** 1992 World Cup, South Africa, England, rain rule, cricket, semi-final, controversy,  farcical,  World Cup moments, Cricket World Cup history,  cricket rules. \n","tags":["World Cup 2019","World Cup moments","Cricket","South Africa vs England"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/924050/world-cup-moments-when-a-farcical-rain-rule-drowned-south-africas-final-hopes-and-forced-a-change","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2019-05-20T18:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/120046-uokkqpptet-1558311272.jpg","id":"cd3756d5-83fa-5f41-8d62-6c8debec5fae"}
