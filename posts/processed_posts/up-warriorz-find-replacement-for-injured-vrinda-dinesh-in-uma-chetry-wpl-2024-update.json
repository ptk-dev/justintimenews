{"title":"UP Warriorz Find Replacement for Injured Vrinda Dinesh in Uma Chetry: WPL 2024 Update","content":"\nThe UP Warriorz have signed wicketkeeper batter Uma Chetry as a replacement for the injured Vrinda Dinesh, who was ruled out of the Women's Premier League 2024 after sustaining a shoulder injury. Dinesh, a star player, was bought for a whopping Rs 1.3 crore, making her the second most expensive uncapped player in the auction. \n\nChetry, who went unsold in the initial auction, has been brought in for her base price of Rs 10 lakh. The young talent has already represented India A in international matches and was a key player in India A's 2023 ACC Emerging Women's Asia Cup victory. With her experience and talent, Chetry is poised to fill the gap left by Dinesh's absence and contribute significantly to the Warriorz's campaign. \n","tags":["Cricket","Women's Premier League","Vrinda Dinesh","Uma Chetry","UP Warriorz"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1064704/wpl-2024-up-warriorz-rope-in-uma-chetry-as-replacement-for-injured-vrinda-dinesh","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-04T19:37:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/198997-zspggsgunc-1709561241.jpeg","id":"93845066-e781-571e-88ff-3ad1fde83f87"}
