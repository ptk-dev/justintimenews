{"title":"Uttarakhand's Uniform Civil Code: A Step Forward, But With Blind Spots","content":"\nUttarakhand's new Uniform Civil Code aims to create a unified set of personal laws for all citizens, eliminating discriminatory practices against women. However, it faces criticism for leaving out key groups, including tribal communities and LGBTQIA+ individuals. \n\nThe law prohibits polygamy, a move welcomed by many Muslim women who see it as oppressive. However, the ban excludes tribal groups, despite evidence that polygamy is more prevalent and harmful in these communities.  \n\nThe code also includes controversial clauses regarding live-in relationships, requiring couples to register within 30 days. While intended to protect women, critics argue it is a regressive move that infringes on individual freedom and privacy. \n\nFurthermore, the code fails to address the needs of transgender individuals, despite the Supreme Court's decriminalization of homosexuality. \n\nWhile the UCC represents a step towards equality, it remains incomplete and fails to adequately address the needs of diverse communities in Uttarakhand. \n","tags":["uniform civil code","Uttarakhand","Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code","Polygamy","Live-in relationships","Hindu Undivided Families"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1065531/with-gaps-and-overreach-who-does-the-uttarakhand-uniform-civil-code-actually-help","author":"Charu Bahri, IndiaSpend.com","time":"2024-03-27T19:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/188462-mrdjbwdbyt-1679926015.jpg","id":"021431dd-d6dd-5b97-b49e-0fd5ad8194d9"}
