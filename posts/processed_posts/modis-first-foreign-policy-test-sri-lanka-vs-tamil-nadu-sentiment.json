{"title":"Modi's First Foreign Policy Test: Sri Lanka vs Tamil Nadu Sentiment","content":"\nNarendra Modi's first foreign policy test has arrived, even before he takes office.  The invitation extended to Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa for Modi's swearing-in ceremony has sparked controversy.  Tamil Nadu political parties, deeply concerned about alleged war crimes against Tamils in Sri Lanka, have vehemently opposed Rajapaksa's attendance.  \n\nThis conflict pits Modi's strategic interests in Sri Lanka against the strong anti-Rajapaksa sentiment in Tamil Nadu.  While India has a strategic relationship with Sri Lanka, concerns about China's growing influence in the region add complexity.  \n\nTamil Nadu parties have consistently used the issue to gain political mileage, often blurring the lines between humanitarian concerns and support for the LTTE.   Modi's strong mandate, however, may give him the leverage to navigate this delicate situation without succumbing to political pressure.  The real test will be how he manages this delicate balance and what message he conveys to both Rajapaksa and Tamil Nadu. \n","tags":[],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/665192/will-modi-choose-strategic-interests-in-lanka-over-domestic-sentiment-in-tamil-nadu","author":"TM Veeraraghav","time":"2014-05-24T07:21:14+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/665192-94d85c94-7a45-46af-9513-8bc66ae0fc0a.jpg","id":"619ea8f0-4f4e-557c-8ca8-1c7acc7adc41"}
