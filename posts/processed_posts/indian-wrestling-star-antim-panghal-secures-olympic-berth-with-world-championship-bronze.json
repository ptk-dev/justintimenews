{"title":"Indian Wrestling Star Antim Panghal Secures Olympic Berth with World Championship Bronze!","content":"\nAntim Panghal, the rising star of Indian wrestling, has made the nation proud! The 19-year-old grappler clinched a bronze medal at the World Wrestling Championships in Belgrade, Serbia, securing an Olympic quota for India in the women's 53 kg freestyle event.  \n\nPanghal's journey to the podium was filled with thrilling victories. She started with an upset win over the reigning world champion, Dominique Olivia Parrish of the United States.  She then dominated her opponents, showcasing impressive technique and determination.  \n\nWhile the bronze medal is a remarkable achievement, the Olympic quota is a significant milestone.  However, it's important to note that the quota belongs to India, not specifically to Panghal.  This means another Indian wrestler could potentially compete for the spot at the Paris 2024 Olympics. \n\nPanghal's next goal is the Asian Games in Hangzhou, where she aims to continue her winning streak.  Her journey is an inspiration to aspiring athletes across India, proving that with hard work and dedication, anything is possible. \n","tags":["Antim Panghal","World Wrestling Championships","Wrestling","Indian wrestling","World Wrestling Championships 2023","Paris 2024 Olympics"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1056381/world-wrestling-cships-antim-panghal-wins-bronze-clinches-paris-2024-olympics-quota-for-india","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-09-22T11:36:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/178719-fwzraxwiud-1660979138.jpg","id":"12e8b937-c4e5-5b94-995a-df490506d335"}
