{"title":"Indian Wrestlers Threaten Legal Action Against WFI Chief,  Oversight Committee Silence","content":"\nIndia's star wrestler Vinesh Phogat has announced that she and other wrestlers will consider legal action if the Oversight Committee's findings on sexual harassment allegations against Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh are not released. \n\nThe wrestlers, including Tokyo Olympics bronze medalist Bajrang Punia and Rio Olympics bronze medalist Sakshi Malik, have been protesting the WFI's functioning since January, demanding Brij Bhushan's removal. The Sports Ministry formed the Oversight Committee to investigate the allegations, but Phogat expressed disappointment that the wrestlers were not consulted in its formation.\n\nPhogat, Punia, and other wrestlers have criticized the lack of transparency regarding the committee's investigation and findings, claiming their voices are being ignored.  They are particularly concerned about the upcoming Open National Senior Ranking Wrestling Tournament being held in Gonda, Brij Bhushan's stronghold. Phogat believes this demonstrates the WFI president's continued influence despite being removed from his position.  \n\nThe wrestlers' threat of legal action highlights the growing frustration and lack of faith in the committee's ability to deliver justice. The situation underscores the need for a transparent and swift resolution to the sexual harassment allegations against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.\n","tags":["Vinesh Phogat","Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh","Wrestling","Wrestling Federation of India","MC Mary Kom"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1047117/wrestling-vinesh-phogat-says-wrestlers-to-consider-going-to-court-in-fight-against-wfi-chief","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-04-10T14:29:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/185819-iegzwyzwvp-1674125161.jpg","id":"77dad6ca-1a32-5664-99aa-0e072afa9076"}
