{"title":"Delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir: A Political Chess Game?","content":"\nTwo years after Article 370 was revoked,  Prime Minister Modi met with Jammu and Kashmir's mainstream leaders, hinting at the restoration of statehood. However, the real agenda appeared to be  **delimitation** – a process of redrawing electoral boundaries.\n\nThis exercise, while routine in other states, is highly sensitive in Jammu and Kashmir, as it could significantly alter the political landscape of the former Muslim-majority state. \n\nThe BJP, many believe, might use this opportunity to gain a political advantage in the region, potentially leading to a Hindu chief minister in the future.\n\nWhile some mainstream leaders are critical of the process, others seem to be accepting it, fearing further disempowerment. \n\nThe question remains – will they dare to resist  Modi's plan, or will they succumb to the political pressure? \n\n**Long tail keywords:** Jammu and Kashmir delimitation, delimitation commission, BJP Jammu and Kashmir, Article 370, Kashmir politics, Jammu and Kashmir elections, statehood restoration,  Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, Kashmir mainstream leaders, Modi's plan,  political chess game,  electoral boundaries, political advantage,  Hindu chief minister. \n","tags":["Jammu and Kashmir","Delimitation"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/998945/will-kashmirs-mainstream-political-leaders-stand-against-modis-plan-to-carry-out-delimitation","author":"Safwat Zargar","time":"2021-07-02T09:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/160728-xyqylenbzk-1624535235.jpg","id":"77d13b8a-c020-5a3e-a7cc-1a45e88f9580"}
