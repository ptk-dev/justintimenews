{"title":"Sanatana Dharma Row:  Union Minister Threatens Violence, BJP Demands Clarification From Congress","content":"\nThe ongoing controversy over Sanatana Dharma escalated further after Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat threatened violence against anyone criticizing the faith. This followed Tamil Nadu Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin's call for \"eradicating\" Sanatana Dharma, a term some consider synonymous with Hinduism.\n\nShekhawat's incendiary remarks sparked outrage, with the BJP demanding the Congress and its INDIA alliance condemn Stalin's statement. The BJP accused the opposition of deliberately targeting Sanatana Dharma for political gains. \n\nThe controversy has raised concerns about rising religious intolerance and the potential for further polarization in Indian politics. It remains to be seen how this issue will unfold and what steps will be taken to address the escalating tensions. \n","tags":["Sanatana Dharma","Gajendra Singh Shekhawat","Udhayanidhi Stalin","INDIA Alliance","BJP","Hindutva Politics"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1055892/will-pull-out-tongue-gouge-out-eyes-of-those-who-speak-against-sanatana-dharma-says-union-minister","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-09-13T14:08:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/194038-hcoyyymbfa-1694591950.jpg","id":"42ee8a60-ee26-5294-b8d9-51931da5fa36"}
