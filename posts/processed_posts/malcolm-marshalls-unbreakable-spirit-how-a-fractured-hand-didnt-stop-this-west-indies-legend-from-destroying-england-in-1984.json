Marshall, with a heavily bandaged hand, returned to bowl and ripped through the English batting lineup, claiming 7 wickets. His grit and determination were an inspiration, proving that even a broken hand couldn't stop this true warrior. This incredible display of courage and commitment is a testament to the legendary spirit of Malcolm Marshall and the West Indies team of that era. \n","tags":["Cricket","Malcolm Marshall","England vs West Indies"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/966631/with-a-fractured-hand-and-a-smile-when-west-indies-fast-bowler-malcolm-marshall-destroyed-england","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2020-07-06T14:38:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/143964-wnynzymcgj-1594020384.jpg","id":"cd06135d-f5a3-5097-b943-3ec5bf67ece5"}
