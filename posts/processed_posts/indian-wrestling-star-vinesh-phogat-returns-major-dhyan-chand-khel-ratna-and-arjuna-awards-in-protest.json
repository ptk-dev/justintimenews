{"title":"Indian Wrestling Star Vinesh Phogat Returns Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna and Arjuna Awards in Protest","content":"\nIndian wrestler Vinesh Phogat, a two-time World Championship medalist, has returned her prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna and Arjuna awards in protest against the alleged sexual harassment by former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.\n\nPhogat, who has been at the forefront of the year-long protest against Singh, expressed her decision in a statement addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, stating that the awards have lost their meaning amidst the ongoing struggle for justice. Her decision comes after fellow wrestler Bajrang Punia returned his Padma Shri award and Sakshi Malik announced her retirement from wrestling.\n\nThis powerful act of defiance highlights the deep-seated frustration and anger among India's top wrestlers towards the WFI and its leadership. The protest, which has seen wrestlers camping at Jantar Mantar in Delhi for weeks, demands the removal of Singh and a thorough investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment. \n","tags":["Wrestling","Wrestling Federation of India","Vinesh Phogat","Arjuna Award","Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna","Bajrang Punia","Sakshi Malik"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1061204/wrestling-vinesh-phogat-returns-khel-ratna-arjuna-awards-in-protest","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-12-26T20:06:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190672-tcjmykwnih-1685295620.jpg","id":"b4cc5ea6-9792-5334-9be3-2f1e6c236346"}
