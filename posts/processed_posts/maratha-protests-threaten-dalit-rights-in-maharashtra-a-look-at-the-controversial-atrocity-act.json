{"title":"Maratha Protests Threaten Dalit Rights in Maharashtra:  A Look at the Controversial Atrocity Act","content":"\nThe Maratha community in Maharashtra is demanding the repeal of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, citing its alleged misuse.  This demand has sparked fear among Dalits, who see the Act as crucial protection against caste-based violence. \n\nThe Maratha protests come in the wake of a brutal gangrape and murder of a Maratha girl, leading to calls for reservation and a crackdown on alleged misuse of the Act. However, Dalits argue that the Act is vital, pointing to numerous cases of caste-based crimes, including the murder of Nitin Aage in 2014 and the Rohidas Tupe case in 2009. \n\nDespite the Act's existence, Dalits continue to face discrimination and fear. The lack of data on caste crimes, the prevalence of counter-cases against Dalit victims, and the inadequate implementation of the Act all contribute to this ongoing struggle. \n\nThe Maratha agitation has brought to light the deeply rooted caste divisions in India, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to address caste-based violence and ensure justice for all. \n","tags":["Dalits","caste crimes","atrocity Act"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/817115/with-marathas-targeting-the-caste-crime-law-maharashtra-dalits-fear-the-return-of-the-old-days","author":"Rahi Gaikwad","time":"2016-09-25T09:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/817115-41945-jkpluqynut-1474463257.jpg","id":"1fb809bb-9f14-5581-865e-8f16eca1289d"}
