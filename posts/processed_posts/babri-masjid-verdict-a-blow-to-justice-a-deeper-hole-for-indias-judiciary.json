{"title":"Babri Masjid Verdict: A Blow to Justice, A Deeper Hole for India's Judiciary?","content":"\nThe recent acquittal of all accused in the Babri Masjid demolition case has sent shockwaves through India. The judgment, delivered after a 28-year delay, has been widely condemned as a travesty of justice and a blow to the nation's conscience. \n\nWhile the CBI court claims lack of conclusive evidence, the blatant disregard for overwhelming evidence, including newspaper reports, photographs, and video footage, raises serious questions about the court's impartiality. The court's decision to conveniently blame faceless elements ignores the clear role of BJP leaders in instigating the demolition, further eroding public faith in the judiciary.\n\nThis judgment, coupled with the Supreme Court's decision to award the disputed site to the Hindu side, despite their involvement in the demolition, paints a grim picture of judicial accountability in India. The Babri Masjid verdict has not only failed to deliver justice but has also legitimized a dangerous precedent, potentially paving the way for further erosion of India's secular fabric.\n","tags":["Ayodhya","Babri Masjid","Supreme Court"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/974619/with-the-babri-masjid-verdict-the-judiciary-has-dug-its-reputation-into-an-even-deeper-hole","author":"Sruthisagar Yamunan","time":"2020-10-02T09:00:00+05:30","image":"https://s02.sgp1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/104552-zmvxxtkomk-1580902396.jpg","id":"79e6f038-e948-5777-a6b7-ebedbb31d78b"}
