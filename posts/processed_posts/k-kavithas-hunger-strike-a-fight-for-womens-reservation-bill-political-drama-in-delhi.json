{"title":"K Kavitha's Hunger Strike: A Fight for Women's Reservation Bill &  Political Drama in Delhi","content":"\nK Kavitha, daughter of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao, staged a day-long hunger strike in Delhi demanding the passage of the Women's Reservation Bill, which seeks to reserve 33% seats for women in Parliament and state assemblies. This comes just a day before she is scheduled to appear before the Enforcement Directorate in connection with alleged irregularities in the Delhi liquor policy. \n\nKavitha's hunger strike has attracted the support of several opposition leaders, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, who inaugurated the protest.  The event has added fuel to the ongoing political drama in Delhi, highlighting the opposition's united front against the BJP government and the ongoing investigations surrounding the Delhi liquor policy. \n\nThe Women's Reservation Bill, which has been pending for 27 years, remains a key point of contention between the ruling BJP and the opposition.  While the BJP has promised to implement the legislation, it has failed to secure its passage in Parliament despite having a majority.  Kavitha's hunger strike, therefore, serves as a powerful reminder of the long-standing demand for women's representation in Indian politics.\n","tags":["Womenâ€™s Reservation Bill","K Kavitha","BRS","ED","Delhi liquor policy case","CBI"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1045368/womens-quota-bill-kcrs-daughter-leads-hunger-strike-in-delhi-12-opposition-leaders-to-join","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-03-10T15:31:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/187797-jnsqfhlken-1678441590.jpg","id":"78bc4080-95e5-5f88-931b-541ecf765234"}
