The women have been protesting in Rajasthan, demanding memorials for their fallen husbands, compassionate job appointments, and improved infrastructure in their villages.\n\nOne widow, Manju Jat, accused the police of assault, stripping, and torture. She has gone on a hunger strike, blaming the Rajasthan Chief Minister for the alleged mistreatment. The NCW Chairperson, Rekha Sharma, has written to the Rajasthan DGP demanding a thorough investigation and a detailed action taken report.\n\nThe incident has sparked a political debate, with the BJP accusing the Rajasthan government of mishandling the situation. The Chief Minister, Ashok Gehlot, has countered these claims, alleging that some BJP leaders are using the widows for political gain. This issue has thrust the spotlight on the plight of the widows, raising questions about their safety, demands, and the government's response. \n","tags":["National Commission for Women","Rekha Sharma","Rajasthan","Pulwama"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1045310/womens-panel-seeks-rajasthan-police-report-on-allegations-of-assault-on-protestors","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-03-09T17:24:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/187758-atwsuzuill-1678359724.jpg","id":"cfcfe97b-259a-5f43-ae25-760c829cffa2"}
