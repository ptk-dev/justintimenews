{"title":"Manipur's \"Nupi Lan\": When Women's Voices Shook the British Empire","content":"\nIn 1904 and 1939, the women of Manipur, India, staged powerful protests known as the \"Nupi Lan\" (\"Women's War\") against British colonial policies and local injustices. These protests highlight the enduring strength and resilience of Manipuri women, who have consistently fought for their rights and those of their communities.\n\nThe first Nupi Lan erupted in 1904, sparked by the reintroduction of forced labor. Thousands of women, led by the powerful traders of the Ima Keithel (Mother's Market), marched and boycotted until the unjust policy was revoked. \n\nIn 1939, the second Nupi Lan erupted against unfair rice export policies that led to local shortages and skyrocketing prices. These women bravely confronted authorities, demanding a ban on rice exports and the closure of rice mills. Their actions, though met with brutal force, ultimately led to concessions from the Maharaja.\n\nThese powerful protests, known as \"Nupi Lan\" and \"Nupi Lan Day,\" stand as a testament to the historical significance of women's movements in India. They demonstrate the power of collective action, the unwavering courage of Manipuri women, and the importance of recognizing and celebrating their contributions to social change. \n","tags":["India","Manipur","Women"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/955381/womens-day-remembering-manipurs-historic-nupi-lan-movements","author":"Shruti Chakraborty, Sahapedia","time":"2020-03-08T14:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/137892-dhukyfexnk-1583500698.jpg","id":"d4150810-fe4c-57ca-b5c4-7131ccb57c0c"}
