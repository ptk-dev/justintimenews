{"title":"Indian Table Tennis: From Underdogs to World Beaters -  A New Dawn for the Sport","content":"\nIndian table tennis is experiencing a remarkable surge, with players consistently defeating top-ranked opponents.  Manika Batra's recent rise to the top 25 in women's singles rankings follows a string of impressive victories by Indian paddlers.\n\nThe women's team, in particular, has been making waves. Ayhika Mukherjee's victory over reigning world champion Sun Yingsha at the World Team Table Tennis Championships showcased her aggressive playing style.  Sreeja Akula's impressive win against Yidi in the same tournament further highlighted the growing strength of Indian women's table tennis.\n\nThis newfound success isn't limited to the women.  Sharath Kamal's quarterfinal appearance at the Singapore Smash, Sathiyan Gnanasekaran's WTT Feeder title win, and the men's doubles title victory by Manav Thakkar and Manush Shah are all signs of a bright future for Indian table tennis.\n\nWith both the men's and women's teams qualifying for the Olympics for the first time, India's table tennis players are poised to make history in Paris.  The recent string of victories shows that they have the potential to challenge the dominance of China and secure a place among the world's best.  \n","tags":["Table Tennis","Manika Batra","Ayhika Mukherjee","Sreeja Akula","Sutirtha Mukherjee","Sharath Kamal","Sathiyan Gnanasekaran","Game Points"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1067864/world-beaters-indian-table-tennis-players-mark-an-unprecedented-rise-with-some-big-wins","author":"Abhijit Nair","time":"2024-05-16T08:15:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/200535-lesvjawczs-1715007484.jpeg","id":"12a99f44-8e05-5cdc-aa55-001b521196e3"}
