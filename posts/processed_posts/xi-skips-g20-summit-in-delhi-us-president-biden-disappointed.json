{"title":"Xi Skips G20 Summit in Delhi, US President Biden Disappointed","content":"\nChinese President Xi Jinping will not be attending the G20 Summit in New Delhi this week. Instead, Premier Li Qiang will represent China. This comes as a disappointment to US President Joe Biden, who had hoped to meet with Xi at the summit. \n\nWhile Xi's absence is a blow to hopes for a bilateral meeting, Biden and Xi are expected to meet later this year at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco. \n\nThe G20 summit will be held in Delhi on September 9 and 10, with several world leaders in attendance, including French President Emmanuel Macron, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Notably, Russian President Vladimir Putin will also skip the summit, sending Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov instead. \n\nThe G20, comprising 20 major economies, accounts for a significant portion of global GDP, trade, and population. The annual summit rotates presidency, with India holding the position in 2023. \n","tags":["Joe Biden","G20 Summit","Xi Jinping","India"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1055379/xi-jinping-to-skip-g20-summit-in-delhi","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-09-04T14:03:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/193745-wzeaaldvsa-1693815104.jpg","id":"e02e70ba-ff17-54c8-a53f-d3a7f44c4e58"}
