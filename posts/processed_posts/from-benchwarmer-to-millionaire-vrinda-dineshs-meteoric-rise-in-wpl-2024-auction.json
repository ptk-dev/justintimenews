{"title":"From Benchwarmer to Millionaire: Vrinda Dinesh's Meteoric Rise in WPL 2024 Auction","content":"\nVrinda Dinesh, a 22-year-old leg-spinner from Karnataka, went from practicing at the nets in Raipur to being one of the most sought-after players at the WPL 2024 auction in Mumbai. Her exceptional performance in the Senior Women's T20 Trophy, which included a stunning strike rate of 154, caught the attention of all five franchises, ultimately leading to her being picked by the UP Warriorz for a whopping â‚¹1.3 crore. \n\nVrinda's journey to this point has been anything but ordinary. After a two-year hiatus from the senior state team, she returned in 2020 with two back-to-back centuries, marking a turning point in her career.  Her transformation as a batter, guided by her coach Kiran Uppoor, has seen her evolve from a Test player to a power-hitter, attracting the attention of top franchises. \n\nNow, Vrinda will have the opportunity to play alongside international stars like Alyssa Healy, Tahlia McGrath, Danni Wyatt, and Sophie Ecclestone, an experience she describes as \"surreal.\" While the pressure is high, Vrinda remains focused on giving her best, unfazed by the price tag and eager to enjoy the sport she loves.  \n","tags":["Vrinda Dinesh","WPL","Women's Premier League","Cricket","Indian Cricket","UP Warriorz","Alyssa Healy","Gujarat Giants","Kashvee Gautam"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1060365/wpl-2024-vrinda-dinesh-once-a-benchwarmer-now-one-of-the-most-expensive-players-from-the-auction","author":"Abhijit Nair","time":"2023-12-11T14:36:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/196539-lovaucvqke-1702206568.jpeg","id":"052e0300-5f8e-5265-a708-13c9b567ca90"}
