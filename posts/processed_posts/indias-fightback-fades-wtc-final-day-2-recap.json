{"title":"India's Fightback  Fades:  WTC Final Day 2  Recap","content":"\nThe second day of the World Test Championship Final at The Oval saw a dramatic shift in momentum.  Australia,  riding on a mammoth  285-run partnership between Steve Smith and Travis Head,  declared their innings at 469, leaving India with a mountain to climb. \n\nIndia's  early  promise  of  a fightback  turned  into a top-order collapse.  Experienced batters like Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara  fell cheaply,  leaving  India  reeling at 71/4. However,  Ajinkya Rahane  made a  remarkable comeback  after  nearly 18 months,  scoring 46 runs  in  a  71-run  partnership  with  Jadeja,  providing  a glimmer of hope for India  at the  stumps. \n\nIndia  still  trails  by  318 runs  with  only  five  wickets  in  hand,  facing  a  long,  tricky  Day 3  at  The Oval. The  match  hangs  in  the  balance,  and  India's  chances  of  winning  now  depend  on  a  miraculous  recovery  from  their  batter,  especially  Rahane. \n","tags":["India","Australia","World Test Championship 2023","ICC World Test Championship","WTC Final","Mohammed Siraj","Steve Smith","Scott Boland","Pat Cummins","Travis Head"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1050594/wtc-final-day-2-from-indias-top-order-collapse-to-rahanes-return-a-look-at-three-talking-points","author":" Samreen Razzaqui","time":"2023-06-09T08:45:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/191042-zespnuwcik-1686245908.jpg","id":"dc98527a-ed6d-5eb0-8a39-2633bd87ef67"}
