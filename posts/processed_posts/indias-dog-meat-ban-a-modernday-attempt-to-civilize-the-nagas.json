{"title":"India's Dog Meat Ban: A Modern-Day Attempt to \"Civilize\" the Nagas","content":"\nThe recent ban on dog meat in Nagaland, fueled by animal activists, highlights a disturbing trend: India's ongoing attempt to \"civilize\" the Naga people. This echoes colonial attitudes that viewed Nagas as needing to be \"tamed\" and \"educated.\" \n\nWhile the ban is presented as a compassionate act, it reveals a deeper issue of cultural superiority. Mainland Indians, acting as \"compassionate citizens,\" are dictating what is \"acceptable\" and \"despicable\" in Naga culture, including their food habits. This echoes the colonial era's \"civilizing mission,\" where Nagas were seen as \"wild\" and needing to be brought into the fold of \"civilization.\" \n\nThis attempt to impose a \"civilized\" standard on Nagas perpetuates a harmful narrative of cultural dominance. It's a reminder that even in post-colonial India, the colonial gaze persists, with the \"center\" trying to control and assimilate the \"periphery.\" The ban on dog meat is not just about animal welfare; it's about control, about silencing Naga culture and identity. \n","tags":["Nagaland","North East politics","food","dog meat"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/966757/with-dog-meat-ban-india-is-still-trying-to-civilise-the-nagas","author":"Roderick Wijunamai","time":"2020-07-08T06:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/144044-zmrwpxpvwb-1594143299.jpg","id":"de145231-2db7-56a9-a2b0-189a66fb731c"}
