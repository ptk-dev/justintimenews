{"title":"Jungle Mahal:  Can BJP Overcome Organizational Woes in Bengal's Tribal Stronghold?","content":"\nThe BJP, despite winning a majority of seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Jungle Mahal, West Bengal's tribal region, faces a formidable challenge in the 2021 Assembly elections.  The party's organizational weakness is a significant hurdle, with local leaders complaining about lack of funds and resources compared to the Trinamool Congress (TMC). \n\nThe BJP's reliance on poaching candidates from other parties, rather than promoting its own workers, has also raised concerns. This lack of organizational depth is evident even at the polling booth level, leading to concerns about the party's ability to effectively mobilize its base.\n\nThe TMC, on the other hand, has consolidated its organization, leveraging its strong network to counter anti-incumbency sentiments.  The party's \"khela hoba\" (game on) slogan reflects its confidence in its ability to utilize its cadre to secure victory.\n\nWhile the BJP's organizational weakness may be a major factor in rural areas, its impact is less pronounced in urban areas where voters are more influenced by media and social media.  The BJP faces a crucial test in Jungle Mahal, where its ability to overcome organizational challenges will determine its electoral success. \n","tags":["West Bengal","Jungle Mahal","BJP","Trinamool Congress","West Bengal Elections 2021","West Bengal Assembly elections 2021"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/990761/will-poor-organisation-be-a-roadblock-for-bjp-in-its-bengal-stronghold-of-jungle-mahal","author":"Shoaib Daniyal","time":"2021-03-29T18:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/156849-xaaogdawyt-1616914436.jpg","id":"4b595f1f-6b8c-520b-8d65-6db6180a0513"}
