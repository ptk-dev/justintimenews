{"title":"India's Youth Unemployment Crisis: Can Government Solve It?","content":"\nA recent report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) paints a stark picture of India's youth unemployment problem.  The report reveals that in 2022, nearly 83% of India's unemployed population were young people. This is a significant increase compared to the period between 2000 and 2019, when youth employment and underemployment were on the rise.\n\nThe report highlights a concerning trend: educated youth, especially women, are disproportionately affected by unemployment. This is particularly alarming in urban areas. \n\nIndia's Chief Economic Advisor, V Anantha Nageswaran, has acknowledged the severity of the situation. He emphasizes the need for the private sector to invest in capital formation and job creation. He believes that the government cannot single-handedly solve the unemployment crisis. \n\nThis statement has sparked controversy, with some criticizing the government's approach and calling for concrete action plans. The Congress party has even promised to unveil its own plan to address unemployment in its upcoming manifesto. \n\nThe ILO report serves as a crucial reminder of the urgent need to address India's youth unemployment problem.  It underscores the importance of tailored solutions that focus on skill development, education reform, and private sector investment.  \n","tags":["V Anantha Nageswaran","unemployment","Chief Economic Adviser","P Chidambaram"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1065864/wrong-to-assume-government-can-solve-unemployment-says-chief-economic-advisor","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-27T16:52:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/169427-jllfqahmnu-1643380931.jpg","id":"0428a740-8943-50d9-98e6-f338dfef0829"}
