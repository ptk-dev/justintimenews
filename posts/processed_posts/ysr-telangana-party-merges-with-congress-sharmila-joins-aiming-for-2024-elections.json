{"title":"YSR Telangana Party Merges With Congress: Sharmila Joins, Aiming for 2024 Elections","content":"\nIn a significant political development, YS Sharmila, the leader of the YSR Telangana Party (YSRTP), has joined the Indian National Congress. This move, announced on Thursday, sees the YSRTP merging with the Congress, marking a major shift in Telangana's political landscape. \n\nSharmila, the daughter of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy, launched the YSRTP in June 2021. Her decision to join the Congress comes after her party's strategic withdrawal from the Telangana Assembly elections last year, which ultimately benefited the Congress. This move, she claims, was a \"sacrifice\" for the Congress, and she has now been invited to work with the party. \n\nThe YSRTP's merger with the Congress, coupled with Sharmila's entry, is expected to bolster the party's prospects in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections. \n","tags":["YS Jagan Mohan Reddy","YS Sharmila","YSR Telangana Party","Congress"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1061554/ysr-telangana-party-chief-ys-sharmila-joins-congress","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-01-04T11:28:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/197195-oqczcqdwri-1704347870.jpg","id":"eb0187f1-e281-52c1-aec3-46eefb97ee3d"}
