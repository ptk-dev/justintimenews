{"title":"Manipur's Displaced Voters Ask: Will Modi Visit If We Vote?","content":"\nThe upcoming Lok Sabha elections hold little significance for Manipur's displaced citizens,  who are grappling with the aftermath of the devastating ethnic violence.  Many, like Kiyam Kajal Chanu, a young Meitei woman who lost her home in the violence, feel disillusioned with the political process. They question the government's response, especially Prime Minister Modi's claim of \"timely intervention,\"  while they remain in relief camps with no hope of returning home. \n\n\"We will not vote unless we can go home,\"  says Rajesh Wangkhem, echoing the sentiment of many displaced individuals.  Even the presence of special polling booths at relief camps has failed to sway them. \n\nThe lack of representation for the Kuki-Zo community, who have been particularly hard hit by the violence, adds to the sense of disenfranchisement.  Their community leaders are considering a boycott of the elections to protest the government's inaction on their demand for a separate administration.\n\nThe election campaign in Manipur is muted, reflecting the deep sense of despair and anger among the people.  The violence has left a lasting mark on the state, with homes destroyed, lives lost, and a fragile peace hanging by a thread.  For many, the upcoming election is simply a reminder of their broken lives and their lost hope. \n","tags":["Manipur","Manipur unrest","Kuki","Meitei","Lok Sabha elections 2024","Lok Sabha 2024"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1066486/will-modi-visit-us-if-we-vote-why-this-election-means-little-for-manipurs-displaced","author":"Rokibuz Zaman","time":"2024-04-11T06:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/199966-apqguowada-1712760854.jpg","id":"9ff5e802-4ba8-5f24-b68f-a1b16598a674"}
