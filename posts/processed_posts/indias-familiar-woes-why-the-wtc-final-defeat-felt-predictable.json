{"title":"India's Familiar Woes:  Why the WTC Final Defeat Felt Predictable","content":"\nIndia's loss in the 2023 ICC World Test Championship Final against Australia at The Oval was a painful reminder of the team's recurring issues. The defeat wasn't a sudden shock, but rather a culmination of familiar problems that have plagued the team for a while. \n\n **Team Selection:** The decision to leave out Ravichandran Ashwin, a world-class spinner, despite favorable pitch conditions raised eyebrows.  \n\n**Batting Struggles:** The Indian batting lineup has been a consistent concern, failing to convert starts into big scores. Their average partnership per dismissal for wickets 1-4 was significantly lower than other top Test teams.\n\n**Workload and IPL:** The intense schedule of the IPL, with its increased travel and lack of acclimatization time, further hampered the team's preparation. \n\n**Missed Opportunities:** The absence of key players like Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant, coupled with the team's lack of adaptability, exposed their vulnerabilities.  \n\nThis defeat highlights the need for a comprehensive review of India's Test cricket strategy.  The team's performance, despite having world-class talent, continues to fall short of expectations.  The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) must address the systemic issues within the team and provide the necessary support to bridge the gap between potential and performance. \n","tags":["ICC World Test Championship Final","Rohit Sharma","Rahul Dravid"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1050755/wtc-final-indias-defeat-against-australia-at-the-oval-had-an-air-of-predictability-around-it","author":"Vinayakk Mohanarangan","time":"2023-06-12T08:49:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/191146-mkbaxraxme-1686518838.jpg","id":"847756d6-d930-5104-a18a-ab49b2fc9224"}
