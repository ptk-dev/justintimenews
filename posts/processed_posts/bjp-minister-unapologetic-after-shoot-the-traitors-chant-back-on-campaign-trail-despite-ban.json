{"title":"BJP Minister Unapologetic After 'Shoot the Traitors' Chant, Back on Campaign Trail Despite Ban","content":"\n**Anurag Thakur, a BJP minister who sparked outrage by leading chants of \"shoot the traitors\" during Delhi election campaigning, has shown no remorse and resumed campaigning despite a three-day ban.**  He continued his inflammatory rhetoric, targeting Shaheen Bagh protesters and even accusing journalists of being barred from the site. \n\nThe Election Commission, despite noting the Delhi Police's inaction against Thakur for his hate speech, has only relieved a police officer after two firing incidents near Jamia Millia Islamia and Shaheen Bagh.  Legal experts point out that the police have ample provisions under the Indian Penal Code to take action against Thakur, but have chosen not to. \n\n**This raises serious questions about the role of the BJP, its ministers, and the police in maintaining law and order and fostering a climate of peace and tolerance.**  The continued silence of the authorities and Thakur's unapologetic behavior signal a dangerous trend of unchecked hate speech and potential incitement of violence in India. \n","tags":["Anurag Thakur","Election Commission of India","Delhi elections","Bharatiya Janata Party"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/952001/zero-remorse-bjp-minister-who-led-shoot-the-traitors-chant-is-back-on-campaign-trail","author":"Vijayta Lalwani","time":"2020-02-03T19:40:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/110192-gcxocsutaz-1580177936.jpg","id":"f7ec80f9-9e84-5b3c-886c-baf107f3ee92"}
