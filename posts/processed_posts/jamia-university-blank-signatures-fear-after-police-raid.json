{"title":"Jamia University: Blank Signatures & Fear After Police Raid","content":"\nFollowing a violent police crackdown on protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act at Jamia Millia Islamia University, female students were asked to sign blank sheets of paper, seemingly to confirm that police never entered the girls' hostels.  This request came despite widespread reports of police entering the campus and even attempting to enter the hostels, prompting fears of safety and harassment amongst the students. \n\nWhile authorities maintain that police never entered the hostels, many students report hearing of police trying to enter and even witnessing police presence near the hostels.  Many students were left terrified, with some even reporting hearing of sexual harassment incidents. \n\nThe university issued an advisory asking students to leave the campus, leading to a mass exodus of students from the hostels.  This incident highlights the fear and uncertainty surrounding the situation at Jamia University, with many students seeking refuge outside the campus. \n","tags":["Jamia protests","Citizenship Amendment Bill","Citizenship Act"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/947003/women-students-at-jamia-asked-to-sign-statements-saying-delhi-police-never-entered-their-hostels","author":"Vijayta LalwaniIpsita Chakravarty","time":"2019-12-16T19:32:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/132950-wimasqcnht-1576502456.jpg","id":"8edcf6d9-2b69-57a0-a181-f9c01f819824"}
