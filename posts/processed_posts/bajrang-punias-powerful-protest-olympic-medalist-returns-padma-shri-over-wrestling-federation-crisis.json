{"title":"Bajrang Punia's Powerful Protest:  Olympic Medalist Returns Padma Shri Over Wrestling Federation Crisis","content":"\nOlympic medalist Bajrang Punia has taken a bold stance against the ongoing crisis within the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI), returning his Padma Shri award in protest against the election of Sanjay Singh, a close associate of accused former president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.\n\nPunia, in a heartfelt letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, detailed the wrestlers' long struggle for justice, highlighting the alleged sexual harassment by Brij Bhushan and the lack of action taken against him. The athlete expressed his anguish over the continued influence of Brij Bhushan's allies within the federation, stating that he cannot accept the \"honour\" of the award while his fellow wrestlers are denied justice and safety. \n\nThis act of defiance underscores the deep-rooted problems within the sport, where power struggles and a lack of accountability continue to affect athletes at all levels. \n","tags":["Bajrang Punia","Narendra Modi","Sanjay Singh","Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh","Wrestling","Sakshi Malik"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1061005/wrestling-bajrang-punia-returns-padma-shri-award-in-protest-of-brij-bhushan-aide-winning-election","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-12-22T17:52:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/185993-rsjernancs-1674483501.jpg","id":"b249d8b0-a81b-5082-91b0-f1fab25b05a6"}
