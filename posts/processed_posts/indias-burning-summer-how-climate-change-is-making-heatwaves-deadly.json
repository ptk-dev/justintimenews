{"title":"India's Burning Summer:  How Climate Change is Making Heatwaves Deadly","content":"\nThe air in Kolkataâ€™s slums feels like fire, residents say, as rising temperatures and humidity make their homes unbearably hot. A new study predicts that by 2100, most days of the year will be dangerously hot in tropical regions like India, putting vulnerable populations at risk.\n\nThis isn't just a problem for the elderly, outdoor workers, and low-income communities, it's a public health crisis.  Extreme heat can lead to heat stroke, a life-threatening condition.\n\nIndia's cities are already experiencing extreme heat events.  Delhi and Kolkata could see a significant increase in days with dangerously high heat indexes.  \n\nWhile adaptation measures like cooling shelters and heat-proofed buildings are important, the best solution is to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  \n\nThis means investing in renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable practices.  We must act now to prevent a future where India's summers become too hot to survive. \n","tags":["Summer","Heatwave","Climate Change"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1033616/without-mitigating-measures-the-health-effects-of-heat-stress-will-worsen-considerably-in-india","author":"Sahana Ghosh","time":"2022-09-30T19:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/173206-lcjjixcsmx-1650277774.jpg","id":"505a8e48-32dc-56ec-9b00-bc60e8a4db66"}
