{"title":"Australian Pacer Lauren Cheatle Out of WPL 2024 Due to Skin Cancer Surgery, Gujarat Giants Sign Lea Tahuhu as Replacement","content":"\nAustralian fast bowler Lauren Cheatle has been forced to withdraw from the upcoming Women's Premier League (WPL) 2024 season due to a skin cancer removal procedure.  The 25-year-old, who was bought by the Gujarat Giants for a hefty Rs 30 Lakhs in the WPL auction, will also miss the remainder of the domestic season for New South Wales. \n\nThe Giants have quickly reacted to this news, securing experienced New Zealand pacer Lea Tahuhu as Cheatle's replacement. Tahuhu brings a wealth of experience to the team, having played 93 ODIs and 80 T20Is for her country, taking 109 and 78 wickets respectively. \n\nThis isn't the first time Cheatle has faced medical challenges.  She had a previous skin cancer removal in 2021 and has battled shoulder injuries for the past four years.  Despite these setbacks, she made a triumphant return to the Australian side in December, making her Test debut against India.  Cheatle is expected to return to pre-season training with New South Wales after the off-season break. \n","tags":["Lauren Cheatle","Women's Premier League","Cricket","Australia women","Gujarat Giants"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1063049/wpl-2024-gujarat-giants-lauren-cheatle-withdraws-after-skin-cancer-surgery","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-02-01T12:02:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/103110-lbpfhawwxw-1539603894.jpg","id":"fd45f1e9-ac42-5ea0-b523-2a577ba6a392"}
