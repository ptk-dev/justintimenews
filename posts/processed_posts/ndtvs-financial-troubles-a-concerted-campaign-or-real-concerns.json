{"title":"NDTV's Financial Troubles: A \"Concerted Campaign\" or Real Concerns?","content":"\n**NDTV, India's oldest and most prestigious private news broadcaster, is facing a storm of controversy surrounding its financial dealings.** The network is under scrutiny from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the press, and its own shareholders, all questioning the legitimacy of its foreign investments. \n\n**The ED investigation focuses on Rs 2,030 crore in foreign investments between 2007 and 2010, allegedly in violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act.** NDTV, in response, has published an FAQ section on its website, vehemently denying any wrongdoing and attributing the scrutiny to a \"concerted campaign\" against the company.\n\n**The network's history is peppered with accusations of being too close to the Congress party, facing credibility issues, and undergoing income tax inquiries.** While NDTV insists that all its transactions were above board, the complex structure of its foreign investments, involving entities like General Electric-owned NBC Universal, has raised eyebrows. \n\n**The controversy highlights the scrutiny faced by media organizations in India, particularly those with close ties to political power.** The narrative surrounding NDTV's financial dealings raises questions about transparency, accountability, and the complex interplay between media, politics, and finance in India. \n\n**This case is likely to draw even more attention to the often-discussed but rarely-explored topic of media ownership and financial transparency in India.** \n","tags":[],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/772870/with-probe-into-its-finances-ndtv-complains-about-concerted-campaign-against-it","author":"Rohan Venkataramakrishnan","time":"2015-12-02T08:15:33+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/772870-8098a9a0-2faf-441e-9135-da6bfd8e1863.jpg","id":"9940321d-bf71-5180-9a34-d7ed3250a446"}
