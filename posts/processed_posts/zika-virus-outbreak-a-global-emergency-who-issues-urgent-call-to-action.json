{"title":"Zika Virus Outbreak: A Global Emergency? WHO Issues Urgent Call to Action","content":"\nThe Zika virus is spreading rapidly, with the World Health Organization (WHO) calling it an \"explosive\" situation.  The virus has been detected in 23 countries across the Americas, and experts predict millions of cases could occur. This is a major concern, especially given the link between Zika and microcephaly, a serious birth defect causing lifelong developmental problems.\n\nThe WHO is holding an emergency meeting on February 1st to determine if the outbreak qualifies as an international public health emergency.  This decision could trigger a global response, including increased funding and research efforts.  There is currently no vaccine or cure for Zika, and pregnant women are advised to avoid areas where the virus is present. \n","tags":["zika"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/802644/zika-virus-is-spreading-explosively-says-who","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2016-01-28T19:48:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/802644-article-epgozmgsyn-1453990684.jpeg","id":"b1fad353-5fc5-5c3b-9106-2105a65d0e6c"}
