The arrest, related to an alleged land scam, has been met with strong condemnation from the opposition, who see it as a politically motivated move by the ruling BJP.\n\nSoren, who resigned as Chief Minister before his arrest, vowed to fight back, citing a poem by Shivmangal Singh Suman. The opposition has accused the BJP of using ED, CBI, and IT as tools to target and silence political opponents. \n\nThe BJP, however, maintains that no one is above the law and that the arrest is a result of a fair investigation. The arrest has fueled tensions between the ruling BJP and the opposition INDIA bloc, setting the stage for a heated political battle in the upcoming elections. \n","tags":["Hemant Soren","Jharkhand","Enforcement Directorate"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1063064/wont-give-up-says-hemant-soren-after-being-arrested-by-enforcement-directorate","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-02-01T15:01:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/198067-zfrvmcnztg-1706778517.jpg","id":"860094e3-0ede-50e1-a483-44d44a8e40b1"}
