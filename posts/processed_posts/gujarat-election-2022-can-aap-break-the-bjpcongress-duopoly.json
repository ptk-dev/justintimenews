{"title":"Gujarat Election 2022: Can AAP Break the BJP-Congress Duopoly?","content":"\nThe Gujarat Assembly elections are heating up, but the political atmosphere is surprisingly \"thanda\" (cold).  The BJP is the frontrunner, and the Congress campaign has been muted.  However, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is stirring things up, hoping to disrupt the decades-long dominance of the BJP and Congress.\n\nAAP has run a vibrant campaign, especially on social media, promising to change Gujarat's politics.  While experts remain cautious, they acknowledge AAP's potential to shake things up, particularly if they manage to secure a substantial vote share. This could signal a long-term shift in Gujarat's political landscape.\n\nAAP's success hinges on siphoning off anti-BJP votes from the Congress. They are targeting disaffected rural voters, struggling farmers, and urban residents unhappy with the state's economic performance. \n\nWhile AAP has made inroads in some areas like Saurashtra and Surat, they lack a strong presence in most of central and north Gujarat. The Congress, despite its internal challenges, is still seen as a stronger challenger.  \n\nThe upcoming results will reveal if AAP can truly break the two-party system in Gujarat or if it's just a temporary ripple in the state's political pond.  \n","tags":["Gujarat","Gujarat elections 2022","Aam Aadmi Party"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/1038983/will-the-aam-aadmi-party-change-gujarats-two-party-politics","author":"Arunabh Saikia","time":"2022-12-05T06:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/160329-azcxucrgqi-1623664268.jpg","id":"6fcbb11d-c443-5da0-9a20-a6cef79aca0c"}
