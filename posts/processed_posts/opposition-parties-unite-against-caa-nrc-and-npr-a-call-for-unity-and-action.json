{"title":"Opposition Parties Unite Against CAA, NRC, and NPR: A Call for Unity and Action","content":"\nTwenty opposition parties in India have come together to voice their strong disapproval of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and National Population Register (NPR). The parties, led by Congress President Sonia Gandhi, passed a resolution demanding the government withdraw the CAA and stop the NRC and NPR projects. \n\nThe resolution highlights the unconstitutional nature of these policies, accusing the government of targeting vulnerable communities like minorities, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes. The parties also condemned the government's handling of the economy, calling it a \"complete mismanagement\" leading to an economic crisis.  \n\nThe resolution calls for the people of India to join the opposition in solidarity on key dates including the birthday of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, Republic Day, and the anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi's assassination. \n\nSonia Gandhi, in a powerful address, accused the government of spreading hatred and dividing the nation. She condemned the police brutality against student protests and called for a united front to thwart the government's divisive agenda. \n","tags":["Opposition","Sonia Gandhi","Congress"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/949757/withdraw-caa-stop-nrc-and-npr-projects-20-opposition-parties-tell-centre-in-resolution","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2020-01-13T19:19:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/134547-nvozuzwngj-1578917093.jpg","id":"3509f492-2c28-51d4-8920-d4c4f8b547cc"}
