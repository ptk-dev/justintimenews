Director Vivek Agnihotri has issued a bold challenge to Israeli filmmaker Nadav Lapid, who called the film \"propaganda\" and \"vulgar\" at the International Film Festival of India (IFFI).  Agnihotri has vowed to quit filmmaking if Lapid can prove the events depicted in the movie are false. \n\nAgnihotri, known for his strong opinions, claims he interviewed 700 people for the film and questioned if their accounts of atrocities were \"propaganda.\" Lapid, who headed the IFFI jury, expressed his and the jury's \"disturbance\" at the film's inclusion in the competition section.  \n\nThis clash highlights the sensitive nature of \"The Kashmir Files,\" a film that explores the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits in the 1990s. The controversy sparks debate about artistic freedom, historical accuracy, and the role of film in shaping public opinion.  \n","tags":["Nadav Lapid","Vivek Agnihotri","The Kashmir Files"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1038666/will-quit-filmmaking-if-nadav-lapid-can-prove-flaws-in-kashmir-files-says-vivek-agnihotri","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2022-11-30T13:58:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/115008-eaeqbaoqss-1552363218.jpg","id":"9e0f687d-c87b-5f90-afb3-088d9b54c5b8"}
