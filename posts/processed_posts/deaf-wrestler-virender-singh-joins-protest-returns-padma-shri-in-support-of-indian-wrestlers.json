His decision to return the prestigious award underscores the growing outrage and calls for accountability within Indian wrestling. \n\nThis latest development adds to the escalating crisis within the sport, with athletes taking a stand against the perceived lack of action against those accused of wrongdoing. \n","tags":["Wrestling","Virender Singh","Bajrang Punia","Padma Shri","Narendra Modi","Sakshi Malik","Vinesh Phogat"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1061039/wrestling-deaf-wrestler-virender-to-return-padma-shri-in-solidarity-with-protesting-grapplers","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-12-23T17:17:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/154113-lmdwxpuerx-1612004059.jpg","id":"8525dff5-fd92-5dae-9985-8afbb9dd9f51"}
