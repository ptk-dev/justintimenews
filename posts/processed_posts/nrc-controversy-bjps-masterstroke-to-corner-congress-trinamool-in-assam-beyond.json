{"title":"NRC Controversy: BJP's Masterstroke to Corner Congress & Trinamool in Assam & Beyond","content":"\nThe BJP is using the National Register of Citizens (NRC) controversy in Assam to its advantage, aiming to corner both the Congress and the Trinamool Congress.  This move, seen as a masterstroke by the BJP, positions the party as a strong and decisive leader, shifting focus away from economic issues and emphasizing its communal agenda.\n\nThe BJP strategically amplified the issue, accusing opposition parties of protecting Bangladeshi infiltrators. This tactic resonates deeply in Assam, where anxieties about demographic change are high.  The party also skillfully framed the controversy as a national issue, extending the debate beyond Assam and West Bengal, targeting the Congress and its historic ties to the Assam Accord. \n\nThe BJP's strategy is to keep the issue simmering, using it as a powerful tool to shape the political narrative leading up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.  They are using the NRC to polarize voters, playing the Hindu-Muslim card and positioning themselves as the only party capable of protecting Indian citizens.  \n\nWhile the Congress attempts to maintain a neutral stance, the BJP's calculated strategy has placed them in a precarious position, leaving them vulnerable to the BJP's accusations. \n","tags":["National Register of Citizens","Assam","Bharatiya Janata Party","Amit Shah","Assam Accord"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/888751/with-nrc-controversy-bjp-has-found-another-issue-to-try-to-corner-the-trinamool-and-congress","author":"Anita Katyal","time":"2018-08-01T12:48:48.670877+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/888751-onakqlnvdt-1533065201.jpg","id":"6b55ca9e-02a2-5759-8f42-ec29ce34e6dc"}
