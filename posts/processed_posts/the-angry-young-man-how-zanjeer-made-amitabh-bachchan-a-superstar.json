{"title":"The Angry Young Man: How \"Zanjeer\" Made Amitabh Bachchan a Superstar","content":"\n\"Zanjeer\", released in 1973, was a pivotal film for both Amitabh Bachchan and Hindi cinema. This movie marked the birth of the \"angry young man\" archetype, a character who challenged societal norms and became an icon for a generation seeking change. \n\nSusmita Dasgupta, in her book \"Amitabh: The Making of a Superstar,\" delves into how \"Zanjeer\" transformed Bachchan's career. This film shifted the focus from traditional hero narratives to a more complex portrayal of a man's entire life journey.  Bachchan's \"Vijay\" wasn't just seeking personal revenge, but fought for a larger sense of justice, defying established values. \n\nThe film's success was partly due to the resonance of its themes with the changing socio-political landscape of India. \"Zanjeer\" reflected a society seeking to break free from traditional structures and embrace a more independent, individualistic approach. \n\nAmitabh's own personal journey mirrored the film's themes. He found financial stability and married Jaya Bhaduri, achieving a sense of personal fulfillment. His commitment to the role, even adopting a healthier lifestyle to embody Vijay's character, shows the depth of his dedication. \"Zanjeer\" wasn't just a movie, it was a turning point for both Amitabh Bachchan and Hindi cinema, forever changing the landscape of Bollywood. \n","tags":["Amitabh Bachchan","Zanjeer","Prakash Mehra"],"source":"https://scroll.in/reel/853518/zanjeer-and-amitabh-bachchan-the-movie-and-the-anti-hero-we-both-needed-and-deserved","author":"Susmita Dasgupta","time":"2017-10-11T07:45:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/853518-70642-trwwycazkm-1507573109.jpg","id":"9eee0e4e-da36-5bcb-9082-9e109c062016"}
