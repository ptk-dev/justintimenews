{"title":"\"Martyrs and Votes: Heated TV Debate Sparks Controversy Over PM Modi's 2019 Speech\"","content":"\nDuring a heated television debate on Aaj Tak, Congress spokesperson Alok Sharma challenged anchor Sweta Singh, questioning if it was acceptable to seek votes in the name of martyrs. Singh initially asserted it was not. However, Sharma countered by playing an audio clip of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2019 speech where he appealed to first-time voters to dedicate their vote to the Pulwama martyrs and those who conducted the Balakot airstrikes. This sparked a heated discussion, highlighting a sensitive issue of using national security and military actions for political gain. \n\nThe incident reignited a debate about the use of military references during elections. While the Election Commission of India dismissed complaints regarding Modi's speech, the controversy surrounding the use of martyrs' names for political purposes remains a contentious topic. This incident serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between national pride and political campaigning. \n","tags":["media","BJP","Pulwama Attack"],"source":"https://scroll.in/video/1060345/you-cannot-invoke-martyrs-to-ask-for-votes-says-tv-anchor-panelist-plays-pms-speech-in-response","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-12-10T16:09:00+05:30","id":"80aae4b0-8547-5a74-bcc6-8005855a2eaf"}
