{"title":"Olympic Medalist Sakshi Malik Quits Wrestling After Brij Bhushan Aide Elected WFI Chief","content":"\nIndian wrestler Sakshi Malik, a bronze medalist at the 2016 Rio Olympics, has announced her retirement from the sport, citing the election of Sanjay Singh, a close associate of former Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, as the new president. \n\nMalik, along with other prominent wrestlers, had protested against Brij Bhushan earlier this year, accusing him of sexual harassment. Singh's election has been met with anger and disappointment by the wrestlers, who believe it will perpetuate the culture of harassment within the federation.  \n\n\"We slept on roads for 40 days [during the protest against Brij Bhushan],\" said Malik. \"We fought with all our heart but if the president is like Brij Bushan Sharan Singh – his close aide and business partner – if he stays in the federation then I sacrifice my wrestling career.\"\n\nThis shocking decision highlights the ongoing struggle for justice and accountability within Indian sports. It also raises concerns about the future of women's wrestling in India, with many questioning how the federation can ensure the safety and well-being of athletes under the leadership of someone closely associated with the accused. \n","tags":["Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh","Sanjay Singh","Wrestling Federation of India","Wrestling","Bajrang Punia","Vinesh Phogat","Sakshi Malik"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1060947/wrestling-sakshi-malik-announces-retirement-after-brij-bhushan-sharan-singh-aide-elected-wfi-chief","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-12-21T17:43:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/190922-cxoucmwxfa-1685960377.jpg","id":"b291419c-7cb7-51c6-850b-fbbec46f4526"}
