{"title":"Ashwin Benched, Head Blazes Century:  Australia Dominates Day 1 of the WTC Final","content":"\nAustralia, despite losing the toss, dominated Day 1 of the ICC World Test Championship final, leaving India with a mountain to climb.  Travis Head's blistering century, his first overseas ton against India, stole the show. Head's aggressive approach, in stark contrast to Steve Smith's patient innings,  put India's bowlers under immense pressure. \n\nThe absence of Ravichandran Ashwin in India's lineup sparked a heated debate.  While India opted for an additional seamer, many questioned their strategy, especially considering the potential for the pitch to favor spinners as the match progresses.  \n\nAs Australia finished Day 1 on a commanding 327/3,  Head's century and Smith's near-century  set the stage for a thrilling encounter.  With the pitch likely to favor batsmen as the match progresses,  India faces a daunting task to claw their way back into the contest. \n","tags":["WTC Final","World test championship final","ICC World test championship final","Cricket","Ashwin Ravichandran","R Ashwin","Steve Smith","Travis Head","Ravindra Jadeja"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1050528/wtc-final-ind-v-aus-day-1-ashwins-exclusion-to-heads-century-a-look-at-three-talking-points","author":" Samreen Razzaqui","time":"2023-06-08T08:25:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/191006-ogqhfuzpwq-1686159937.jpg","id":"7304d9ed-f729-57ee-a810-f788c4ffec19"}
