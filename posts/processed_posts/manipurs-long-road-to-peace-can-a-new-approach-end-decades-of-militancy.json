{"title":"Manipur's Long Road to Peace: Can a New Approach End Decades of Militancy?","content":"\nManipur, a state in Northeast India, has been grappling with decades of ethnic militancy. Chief Minister N Biren Singh recently declared the Suspension of Operations (SoO) agreement with Kuki groups a failure, citing lack of seriousness in dialogue and inadequate rehabilitation efforts. While Singh has announced a revised surrender policy for militants, including increased financial incentives, experts believe this is insufficient to address the underlying political issues fueling the conflict.\n\nThe SoO agreement, signed in 2008, aimed to bring peace to the state, but its implementation has been marred by mistrust and a lack of progress on political demands.  The agreement has been criticized for its counter-insurgency approach, which has been seen as pitting ethnic groups against each other. \n\nDespite the challenges, there are some positive signs.  Violence has decreased in recent years, and there is a growing sense that a new approach to peacebuilding is needed.  However, the success of any peace process will depend on addressing the root causes of the conflict, including political aspirations, economic disparities, and historical grievances.  \n\nThe future of Manipur's peace hangs in the balance. Only by embracing a comprehensive and inclusive approach to peacebuilding can the state hope to finally overcome the legacy of militancy and usher in an era of lasting peace.\n","tags":["Manipur","Militancy"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/838401/will-manipur-change-tack-in-its-approach-to-militancies-that-have-riven-the-state-for-decades","author":"Ipsita Chakravarty","time":"2017-05-23T12:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/838401-58778-cjfqcpxmpa-1495465914.jpg","id":"bf7f64e6-63e0-5d28-a208-08f56d60b62c"}
