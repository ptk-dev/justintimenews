{"title":"India's Census: A History in Peril - NRC Fears Threaten Crucial Data Collection","content":"\nThe upcoming Census of India, a tradition since 1872, faces its biggest challenge yet.  Widespread panic over the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC) is causing fear and potential violence against census enumerators.  \n\nThe NRC, aimed at identifying \"doubtful citizens,\" has sparked anxieties, particularly among marginalized communities who lack proper documentation.  The government's decision to collect data for both the Census and NPR simultaneously has added fuel to the fire, leading many to believe the Census is a veiled attempt to gather information for the NRC.  \n\nThis fear has already manifested in attacks on suspected NPR data collectors and a refusal to cooperate by residents in various states.  Experts warn that this could severely impact the Census's accuracy and potentially render it meaningless, jeopardizing crucial data for government policymaking.  \n\nThe situation raises a critical question: Will India's longstanding tradition of census collection be derailed by the NRC's shadow, marking a significant turning point in the country's history? \n","tags":["Citizenship Amendment Act","National Register of Citizens","Census","National Population Register"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/951745/will-panic-over-nrc-put-census-in-danger-for-the-first-time-in-indias-history","author":"Shoaib Daniyal","time":"2020-02-04T09:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/111719-jzxpvdduzg-1548742552.jpg","id":"f1c133a4-7386-5e45-943f-14bdea76a42f"}
