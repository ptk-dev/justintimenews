{"title":"Pawan Kalyan: Can the Power Star Conquer Andhra Pradesh in 2019?","content":"\nTelugu film star Pawan Kalyan is making a political comeback in Andhra Pradesh, aiming for a win in the 2019 state elections. His recent rallies have drawn massive crowds, but his past support for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has raised concerns among supporters. \n\nPawan's Jana Sena Party is hoping to capitalize on the widespread anger over the denial of special status to Andhra Pradesh, a promise made by the BJP before the 2014 elections. However, analysts believe the TDP is using Pawan to counter the YSR Congress Party, led by Jaganmohan Reddy, who is gaining traction with the Kapu community, a politically influential group in the state.  \n\nThe Kapu community, which makes up a significant portion of Andhra Pradesh's population, is demanding OBC status.  Pawan's ability to win over this crucial voter base will be key to his success.  While his popularity among the youth and women is undeniable, he needs to broaden his appeal to secure a victory in 2019.  \n","tags":["Andhra Pradesh","Assembly elections 2019","Pawan Kalyan"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/816350/will-telegu-star-pawan-kalyans-biggest-hit-yet-be-the-2019-state-elections","author":"GS Radhakrishna","time":"2016-09-14T07:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/816350-article-vuxmwwopox-1460058248.jpeg","id":"df74f25f-b71d-56e3-987e-a58266e62f62"}
