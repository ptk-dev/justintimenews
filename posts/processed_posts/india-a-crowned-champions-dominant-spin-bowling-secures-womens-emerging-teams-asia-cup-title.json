{"title":"India 'A' Crowned Champions: Dominant Spin Bowling Secures Women's Emerging Teams Asia Cup Title!","content":"\nIndia 'A' emerged victorious in the Women's Emerging Teams Asia Cup, defeating Bangladesh by 31 runs in a thrilling final match. The Indian spin duo of Shreyanka Patil (4/13) and Mannat Kashyap (3/20) were the stars of the show, dismantling the Bangladeshi batting order. \n\nDespite a modest 127/7 in their innings, India's bowlers held their nerve, restricting Bangladesh to a paltry 96 in 19.2 overs.  Kanika Ahuja, who also scored an unbeaten 30, was named Player of the Match for her all-round brilliance.  \n\nThis win marks a significant achievement for India 'A', especially considering four of their five scheduled matches were washed out due to rain.  Their dominant performance in the final showcased the depth and talent within the Indian women's cricket team. \n","tags":["ACC Womenâ€™s Emerging Teams Asia Cup","Shreyanka Patil","Mannat Kashyap","Kanika Ahuja","India","Bangladesh","India A","Shweta Sehrawat"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1051318/womens-emerging-teams-asia-cup-india-a-defeat-bangladesh-by-31-runs-to-emerge-champions","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-06-21T14:49:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/191464-vszbmecbva-1687338449.jpeg","id":"9dbf6753-9a18-5a23-b26c-8ca508a3f7e3"}
