{"title":"Nisha Dahiya Secures Olympic Quota for India in Women's 68kg Wrestling at Istanbul World Qualifiers","content":"\nNisha Dahiya has become the fifth Indian wrestler to secure a spot at the 2024 Paris Olympics! She dominated her way to victory in the women's 68kg category at the World Wrestling Olympic Qualifiers in Istanbul, Turkey. \n\nDahiya's journey to the Paris Games began with a strong performance against Belarusian Alina Shauchuk, followed by a decisive win over Czech Republic's Adela Hanzlickova. In the semi-finals, she faced Romania's Alexandra Anghel, securing an impressive 8-4 victory. \n\nDahiya's success comes after Antim Panghal, Vinesh Phogat, Anshu Malik, and Reetika Hooda secured their Olympic berths earlier this year. While the Indian women's wrestlers shone, the Greco-Roman contingent unfortunately failed to secure any quotas. \n\nThe Indian freestyle men's team will be hoping to follow in Dahiya's footsteps and secure their own Olympic spots as the competition continues in Istanbul. \n","tags":["Nisha Dahiya","World Wrestling Olympic Qualifiers","Indian wrestling","Wrestling","2024 Paris Olympics"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1067747/wrestling-world-olympic-qualifiers-nisha-dahiya-wins-paris-quota-in-womens-68kg","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-05-11T10:27:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/179979-sfhquzecke-1663265035.jfif","id":"17e89ddf-108e-5b49-b741-40bb6cd959e0"}
