{"title":"India's Justice System: Two Crimes, Two Realities - The Shocking Disparity in 1993 Bombay Blasts & 1992-93 Mumbai Riots","content":"\nThe execution of Yakub Memon, a convict in the 1993 Bombay bomb blasts, has brought India's justice system under scrutiny.  While Memon's case saw vigorous prosecution, the 1992-93 Mumbai riots, which resulted in over 900 deaths, saw minimal justice served.\n\nA stark comparison emerges: 100 convictions for the blasts, but only three convictions for the riots, those being for minor hate speech charges.  The Maharashtra government's lack of action in the riots, contrasted with its relentless pursuit of the bomb blast case, highlights a deeply disturbing bias in the system.\n\nThe Srikrishna Commission report, which implicated Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray in the riots, was ignored, showcasing a blatant disregard for accountability. This stark disparity in justice delivery raises serious questions about the fairness and impartiality of India's criminal justice system. \n","tags":[],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/743554/yakub-memon-case-one-chart-that-shows-just-how-partisan-indias-justice-system-can-be","author":"Shoaib Daniyal","time":"2015-07-27T10:30:24+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.digitaloceanspaces.com/large/743554-5eead589-09ae-4eaf-abe0-214b72ede4eb.jpg","id":"e9af0d7b-66cf-588a-b382-1d5ec59d743e"}
