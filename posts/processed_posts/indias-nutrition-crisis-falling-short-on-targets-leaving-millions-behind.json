{"title":"India's Nutrition Crisis:  Falling Short on Targets, Leaving Millions Behind","content":"\nDespite progress in reducing malnutrition in India, a new study reveals a concerning reality: the country is likely to miss its 2022 nutrition targets. The National Nutrition Mission (Poshan Abhiyaan), aiming to combat issues like stunting, underweight, and anemia, is not progressing fast enough. \n\nThe study, published in *The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health*, highlights a critical gap:  the  rate of decline in malnutrition indicators, particularly low birth weight, is far slower than needed to achieve the ambitious goals. This signifies a persistent challenge, with widespread malnutrition impacting children across the country. \n\nThe study underscores the importance of addressing the root causes of malnutrition, including poor maternal nutrition and inadequate breastfeeding practices.  It also calls for a re-evaluation of the National Nutrition Mission's targets, suggesting more realistic and achievable goals for 2030. This includes setting specific targets for different regions, considering their socio-economic conditions and tailored interventions.  \n\nFailing to meet these targets has far-reaching consequences.  Malnutrition is a leading cause of death and disability in children, impacting their physical and cognitive development, and ultimately hindering India's progress towards a healthier future.\n","tags":["Malnutrition","Zero Hunger","National Nutrition Mission"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/937920/with-32-of-its-children-underweight-india-is-likely-to-miss-its-2022-nutrition-target","author":"Swagata Yadavar, IndiaSpend.com","time":"2019-09-22T13:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/27171-23043904804_a7ece6ab1a_o.jpg","id":"a262ef12-8fb4-559e-8974-d3ece4d6f6af"}
