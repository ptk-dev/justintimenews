{"title":"Assam's Citizenship Purge: A Sham Trial Threatens Millions","content":"\nAssam, India is on the brink of a citizenship crisis. The state's unique **Foreigners Tribunals**, designed to weed out \"illegal immigrants,\" are being weaponized against Bengali-speaking people, primarily Muslims, in a potential purge of millions. \n\nThese tribunals, riddled with bias and inconsistencies, are effectively stripping people of their citizenship based on flimsy evidence and bureaucratic errors.  The **National Register of Citizens (NRC)**, a controversial registry that aims to identify legitimate Indian citizens, has left over 4 million people in limbo, facing the threat of being declared \"foreigners\" and stripped of their rights.\n\nThe **NRC process** and the **Foreigners Tribunals** have created a climate of fear and uncertainty, with individuals facing detention, deportation, and even suicide. This situation highlights the dangers of **nationalist agendas** and the potential for **statelessness** when citizenship is used as a political tool. \n","tags":["National Register of Citizens","Assam","Foreigners Tribunals","The Process"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/932134/worse-than-a-death-sentence-inside-assams-sham-trials-that-could-strip-millions-of-citizenship","author":"Rohini Mohan","time":"2019-07-30T09:00:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/124674-urfyjqxzbe-1564395397.jpg","id":"601efa38-1274-57cb-aa8e-053b5b7fa82b"}
