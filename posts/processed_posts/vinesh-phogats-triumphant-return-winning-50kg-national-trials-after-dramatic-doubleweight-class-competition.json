{"title":"Vinesh Phogat's Triumphant Return: Winning 50kg National Trials After Dramatic Double-Weight Class Competition","content":"\nVinesh Phogat, a prominent Indian wrestler, made a powerful comeback after a long injury break. She dominated the womenâ€™s 50kg national trials, securing her spot in the Indian team for the 2024 Asian Championships and the World Olympic qualifiers. This victory comes just after India's Tokyo Olympics medalists, Bajrang Punia and Ravi Dahiya, lost their respective trials. \n\nPhogat's win was not without drama. She initially requested to compete in both the 50kg and 53kg categories, but ultimately was only allowed to compete in one weight class per day. She won the 50kg final but lost in the 53kg semi-final. Now, the question remains: will Phogat continue in the 50kg category, or will she challenge Antim Panghal for the 53kg spot in the final trials? \n","tags":["Wrestling","Vinesh Phogat","2024 Paris Olympics","Bajrang Punia","Antim Panghal","Ravi Dahiya"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1065048/wrestling-vinesh-phogat-competes-in-two-weight-divisions-on-return-wins-50kg-national-trials","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-11T21:38:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/193195-giswegavnn-1692095241.jpeg","id":"e32d2617-c485-5108-abad-bc96edaaf5bb"}
