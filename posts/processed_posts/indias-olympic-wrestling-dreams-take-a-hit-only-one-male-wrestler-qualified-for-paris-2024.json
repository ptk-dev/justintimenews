{"title":"India's Olympic Wrestling Dreams Take a Hit: Only One Male Wrestler Qualified for Paris 2024","content":"\nIndia's hopes for a strong showing in men's freestyle wrestling at the 2024 Paris Olympics took a blow this weekend.  Sujeet Kalkal (65kg) and Jaideep Ahlawat (74kg) both lost their respective bronze medal bouts at the World Olympic Wrestling Qualifiers, leaving Aman Sehrawat (57kg) as the only male wrestler to secure a spot. \n\nThis is a significant setback for India, especially in the 65kg category, where they previously won bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.  While a record five women wrestlers will represent India in Paris, the lack of male representation in this traditionally strong category is a cause for concern. \n","tags":["Wrestling","World Olympic Qualifiers","Jaideep Ahlawat","Sujeet Kalkal","Bajrang Punia","Aman Sehrawat"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1067788/wrestling-world-olympic-qualifiers-sujeet-jaideep-lose-india-win-only-one-mens-freestyle-quota","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-05-13T09:33:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/200665-kehqnvkfwj-1715572973.jpeg","id":"3b7daed1-a126-5b1e-afa8-f5ebd27e60ad"}
