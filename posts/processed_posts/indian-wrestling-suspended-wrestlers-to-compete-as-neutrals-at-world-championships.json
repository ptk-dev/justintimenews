{"title":"Indian Wrestling Suspended:  Wrestlers to Compete as Neutrals at World Championships","content":"\nThe Indian Wrestling Federation (WFI) has been suspended by United World Wrestling (UWW), the sport's global governing body, due to its failure to hold timely elections. This suspension means Indian wrestlers will compete as neutral athletes at the upcoming World Wrestling Championships, a crucial qualifying event for the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThe suspension stems from a long-standing crisis within the WFI, triggered by allegations of sexual harassment against former president Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.  Despite multiple attempts to hold elections, legal challenges and political interference have delayed the process, leaving the federation without a democratically elected executive body. \n\nThis suspension throws the future of Indian wrestling into uncertainty, with athletes now facing the added burden of competing under a neutral flag, potentially impacting their chances for Olympic qualification. \n","tags":["Wrestling","Wrestling Federation of India","UWW","Suspended","Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1054819/wrestling-indian-federation-suspended-by-world-body-for-delaying-elections","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2023-08-24T14:01:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/191727-ocmogigcjh-1688048708.jpg","id":"5e626286-8082-5cc3-b4fc-6d501cf11ac6"}
