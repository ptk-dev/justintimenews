{"title":"Gujarat Giants Finally Break Through: Beth Mooney, Laura Wolvaardt Power Win Over RCB in WPL 2024","content":"\nThe Gujarat Giants finally secured their first win of the Women's Premier League 2024 season, defeating the Royal Challengers Bangalore by 19 runs in a thrilling encounter at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi. \n\nThe Giants' victory was powered by a magnificent 140-run opening partnership between Beth Mooney (85*) and Laura Wolvaardt (76), the second-highest in the tournament's history. Their impressive display helped Gujarat set a mammoth target of 200 runs for Bangalore, a target they could only manage to chase down to 180/8. \n\nThe Royal Challengers, despite valiant efforts from Smriti Mandhana, Ellyse Perry, Sophie Devine, and Richa Ghosh, struggled to keep pace with the required run-rate and ultimately fell short of the target. The win catapulted the Gujarat Giants into the top four, while the Royal Challengers Bangalore remain in second place.\n","tags":["Beth Mooney","Laura Wolvaardt","Gujarat Giants","Royal Challengers Bangalore","Womenâ€™s Premier League","WPL","WPL 2024","Cricket"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1064838/wpl-2024-beth-mooney-laura-wolvaardt-guide-gujarat-giants-to-first-win-of-season","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-06T23:19:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/199060-mvydypcjso-1709746719.jpg","id":"3897ec87-27f4-5cbc-8d84-e0b13af6009a"}
