{"title":"Zomato's \"Pure Veg Mode\": Catering to Vegetarian Preferences or Dividing the Delivery World?","content":"\nFood delivery giant Zomato has sparked controversy with its new \"Pure Veg Mode\" and \"Pure Veg Fleet\" aimed at catering to India's large vegetarian population. \n\nZomato CEO Deepinder Goyal argues the service ensures vegetarian customers' food is handled with utmost care, but critics question the move's implications. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram fears the \"fleet\" could discriminate based on delivery personnel's dietary choices. Journalist Sucheta Dalal calls it a \"divisive decision\", worrying about potential future segregation based on religious or dietary preferences. \n\nSome users highlight that the majority of Indians consume non-vegetarian food, raising questions about the business rationale behind catering solely to a smaller segment. \n\nWhile Zomato claims the initiative isn't intended to alienate anyone, its \"Pure Veg Mode\" has ignited a debate about inclusivity and the potential for unintended consequences in the food delivery landscape. \n","tags":["Deepinder Goyal","Pure Veg Mode","zomato"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1065462/zomato-launches-pure-veg-mode-and-pure-veg-fleet-for-food-deliveries","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-19T21:03:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/199395-qfopxewdxw-1710860698.jpeg","id":"171f3ac2-c527-5621-b66c-5584fba36c4e"}
