{"title":"Delhi Capitals Dominate Gujarat Giants, Book WPL 2024 Final Spot!","content":"\nThe Delhi Capitals have stormed into the Women's Premier League 2024 final after a dominant seven-wicket victory over the Gujarat Giants.  Shafali Verma and Jemimah Rodrigues were the stars of the show, smashing a 94-run partnership to chase down a modest target of 127 with an incredible 41 balls to spare. \n\nVerma's explosive innings of 71 runs, including 5 sixes,  and Rodrigues' calm 38* ensured the Giants were never in the contest. The Gujarat Giants, despite a late fightback from Kathryn Bryce, finished with a disappointing wooden spoon finish.  This victory marks the Delhi Capitals' strong performance in the WPL 2024 and sets the stage for an exciting final. \n","tags":["Cricket","2024 WPL","Delhi Capitals","Gujarat Giants","Shafali Verma","Jemimah Rodrigues"],"source":"https://scroll.in/field/1065144/wpl-2024-shafali-verma-jemimah-rodrigues-lead-delhi-capitals-to-commanding-win-over-gujarat-giants","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-03-13T22:35:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/199221-rjqujtwgcs-1710349429.jpg","id":"fa43f769-33e9-584b-aabd-0656fcbc5b2e"}
