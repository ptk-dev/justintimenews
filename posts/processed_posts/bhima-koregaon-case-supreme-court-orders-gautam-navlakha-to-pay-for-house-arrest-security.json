{"title":"Bhima Koregaon Case: Supreme Court Orders Gautam Navlakha to Pay for House Arrest Security","content":"\nThe Supreme Court has ordered human rights activist Gautam Navlakha, accused in the Bhima Koregaon case, to pay the cost of his house arrest security. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had demanded Rs 1.64 crore from Navlakha for the expenses incurred on his security. \n\nThe court, while acknowledging the unusual nature of house arrest, stated that Navlakha cannot escape his liability for the security expenses. It will examine the calculation of expenses filed by both parties in the upcoming hearing on April 23. \n\nNavlakha's lawyers argued that the amount was excessive and contested the calculation methods. The NIA countered, highlighting the substantial resources required for round-the-clock security during house arrest. The court's decision raises questions about the financial burden imposed on individuals under house arrest and the implications of such arrangements for legal proceedings. \n","tags":["National Investigation Agency","Bhima Koregaon Case","Gautam Navlakha","Supreme Court","house arrest"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1066440/you-asked-for-house-arrest-must-pay-for-it-sc-tells-bhima-koregaon-accused-gautam-navlakha","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2024-04-09T19:43:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/128305-idcmxgzkcz-1615796051.jpg","id":"479b8a83-f572-507a-94d9-ae595bc00596"}
