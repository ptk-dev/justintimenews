{"title":"Bengal's Caste Politics: Can BJP's Communal OBC Strategy Win Votes?","content":"\nWest Bengal's politics, traditionally less influenced by caste, are now witnessing a shift. The upcoming election sees both the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vying for the OBC vote. However, the BJP's strategy is unique - it's using a communal angle, alleging that Muslim communities have unfairly benefited from OBC reservations. \n\nThe BJP claims that Hindu OBC groups like Mahishyas have been sidelined and promises to rectify this. This strategy aims to pit Hindu OBCs against Muslim OBCs, creating a potential vote bank for the BJP.\n\nHowever, this strategy faces challenges. The TMC has also promised to include Mahishyas in the OBC quota, and historically, Mahishyas haven't acted as a monolithic voting bloc in Bengal. \n\nThe effectiveness of this strategy remains to be seen. Will the communalization of OBC reservations help the BJP win Bengal's elections? Only time will tell. \n","tags":["OBC reservations","West Bengal","BJP","Trinamool","Left Front","West Bengal Assembly elections 2021"],"source":"https://scroll.in/article/990119/will-the-communalisation-of-obc-reservations-help-the-bjp-in-bengal","author":"Shoaib Daniyal","time":"2021-03-22T06:30:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/156520-ydxuvjdlhj-1616333828.jpeg","id":"5b1ca102-e418-5c13-a162-c7703ddf29e4"}
