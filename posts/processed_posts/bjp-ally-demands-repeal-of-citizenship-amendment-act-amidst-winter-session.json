{"title":"BJP Ally Demands Repeal of Citizenship Amendment Act Amidst Winter Session","content":"\nAgatha Sangma, a Member of Parliament from the National People's Party (NPP), has demanded the repeal of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) during a National Democratic Alliance (NDA) meeting ahead of the Winter Session of Parliament. \n\nSangma, who represents the Tora constituency in Meghalaya, cited the recent repeal of the controversial farm laws as a precedent, arguing that the government should consider public sentiment and repeal the CAA as well. \n\nThe NPP, which heads a coalition government in Meghalaya with the BJP, has expressed concerns about the potential impact of the CAA on the indigenous communities of the Northeast. While the government has introduced safeguards for tribal areas, many remain apprehensive about the law's implications. \n\nThe CAA, which aims to grant citizenship to persecuted religious minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, has been met with widespread opposition, particularly in the Northeast, where it is feared to exacerbate existing anxieties about demographic changes. \n","tags":["Agatha Sangma","Meghalaya","NPP","Winter Session of Parliament","CAA"],"source":"https://scroll.in/latest/1011636/winter-session-of-parliament-bjp-ally-npp-demands-repeal-of-caa","author":"Scroll Staff","time":"2021-11-29T09:58:00+05:30","image":"https://sc0.blr1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/article/166905-ffttjgfvnn-1638158943.jpg","id":"f4467794-7cb7-53ed-89ad-3a6f87de7239"}
